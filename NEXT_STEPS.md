# Next Steps: Author Management and Committee Roles

## 1. Author Management

1. Name Normalization Implementation:
   - Convert to lowercase
   - Remove accents/diacritics
   - Handle special characters
   - Consider handling Asian name formats

2. Create API Endpoints:
   - GET /authors
   - GET /authors/:id
   - POST /authors
   - PUT /authors/:id
   - DELETE /authors/:id

3. Search Functionality:
   - Fuzzy name matching
   - Affiliation search
   - ORCID lookup

## 2. Name Uniqueness Analysis

1. Data Collection:
   - Scrape committee member names from conference websites
   - Extract from proceedings PDFs
   - Use conference history pages

2. Name Analysis:
   - Build list of unique names
   - Identify potential duplicates:
     * Different spellings
     * Name changes
     * Middle name variations
     * Different character sets (e.g., "Schrodinger" vs "Schr√∂dinger")

3. Deduplication Strategy:
   - Manual review interface for ambiguous cases
   - ORCID lookup for verification
   - Affiliation history tracking
   - Name change history

## 3. Committee Management

1. API Implementation:
   - GET /conferences/:id/committee
     * Filter by committee type and position
     * Group by committee type
   - POST /conferences/:id/committee
   - DELETE /conferences/:id/committee/:role_id

2. Role Management:
   - Assignment/removal workflow
   - Historical tracking
   - Duration tracking
   - Committee size limits

3. Statistics and Analysis:
   - Committee size over time
   - Role distribution
   - Gender diversity (if data available)
   - Geographic distribution
   - Institution distribution

## 4. Data Population Strategy

1. Historical Data:
   - Start with most recent conferences (2020-2024)
   - Work backwards chronologically
   - Focus on chairs first, then committee members
   - Record data sources in metadata

2. Validation Rules:
   - Required fields for different time periods
   - Role date validation
   - Affiliation history checks
   - ORCID verification when available

3. Quality Control:
   - Manual review process
   - Automated consistency checks
   - Update frequency guidelines
   - Data source tracking

## 5. API Enhancements

1. Query Parameters:
   - Filter by committee type and position
   - Filter by date range
   - Search by name/affiliation
   - Include/exclude specific fields

2. Bulk Operations:
   - Batch role assignments
   - Committee import/export
   - Role updates

3. Advanced Features:
   - Committee history visualization
   - Role overlap analysis
   - Service time tracking
   - Institution representation analysis
