For any Boolean function, its approximate degree serves as a lower bound on its quantum query complexity, and generically lifts to a quantum communication lower bound for a related function. We introduce a framework for proving approximate degree lower bounds for certain oracle identification problems, where the goal is to recover a hidden binary string latex x ın 0, 1^n given possibly non-standard oracle access to it. Our lower bounds apply to decision versions of these problems, where the goal is to compute the parity of latex x. We apply our framework to the ordered search and hidden string problems, proving nearly tight approximate degree lower bounds of latex Ømega(n/łog^2 n) for each. These lower bounds generalize to the weakly unbounded error setting, giving a new quantum query lower bound for the hidden string problem in this regime. Our lower bounds are driven by randomized communication upper bounds for the greater-than and equality functions."

Previous works on QSS for general access structures focused solely on the existence of perfectly secure schemes, and the share size of the known schemes is necessarily exponential even in cases where the access structure is computed by polynomial size monotone circuits. This stands in stark contrast to the classical setting, where polynomial-time computationally-secure secret sharing schemes have been long known for all access structures computed by polynomial-size monotone circuits under standard hardness assumptions, and one can even obtain shares which are much shorter than the secret (which is impossible with perfect security). While QSS was introduced over twenty years ago, previous works only considered information-theoretic privacy. In this work, we initiate the study of computationally-secure QSS and show that computational assumptions help significantly in building QSS schemes, just as in the classical case. We present a simple compiler and use it to obtain a large variety results: We construct polynomial-time computationally-secure QSS schemes under standard hardness assumptions for a rich class of access structures. This includes many access structures for which previous results in QSS necessarily required exponential share size. In fact, we can go even further: We construct QSS schemes for which the size of the quantum shares is significantly smaller than the size of the secret. As in the classical setting, this is impossible with perfect security. We also apply our compiler to obtain results beyond computational QSS. In the information-theoretic setting, we improve the share size of perfect QSS schemes for a large class of n-party access structures to 1.5^n+o(n), improving upon best known schemes and matching the best known result for general access structures in the classical setting. Finally, among other things, we study the class of access structures which can be efficiently implemented when the quantum secret sharing scheme has access to a given number of copies of the secret, including all such functions in mathsfP and mathsfNP."

Yet, the applicability of quantum algorithms in this setting remains very limited, notably in environments with large state and action spaces. In this work, we design quantum algorithms to train state-of-the-art reinforcement learning policies by exploiting quantum interactions with an environment. However, these algorithms only offer full quadratic speed-ups in sample complexity over their classical analogs when the trained policies satisfy some regularity conditions. Interestingly, we find that reinforcement learning policies derived from parametrized quantum circuits are well-behaved with respect to these conditions, which showcases the benefit of a fully-quantum reinforcement learning framework."

Using this we find a natural extension of #SAT which we call #SAT_±, where variables are additionally labelled by phases, which is GapP-complete. Using graphical reasoning, we find a reduction from #SAT to #2SAT_± in the ZH-calculus. We observe that the DPLL algorithm for #2SAT can be adapted to #2SAT_± directly and hence that Wahlstrom's O^*(1.2377^n) upper bound applies to #2SAT_± as well. Combining this with our reduction from #SAT to #2SAT_± gives us novel upper bounds in terms of clauses and variables that are better than O^*(2^n) for small clause densities of fracmn &lt; 2.25. This is to our knowledge the first non-trivial upper bound for #SAT that is independent of clause size. Our algorithm improves on Dubois' upper bound for #kSAT whenever fracmn &lt; 1.85 and k geq 4, and the Williams' average-case analysis whenever fracmn &lt; 1.21 and k geq 6. We also obtain an upper bound of O^*(1.1740^L) for sSAT in terms of the length of the formula, and find an improved bound on #textbf3SAT for 1.2577 &lt; fracmn łeq frac73. Our results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmic insights, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus was intended for.

The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints.

It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior.

Logical Pauli group operators can be implemented on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a commonly-studied category of codes, by applying a series of physical Pauli X and Z gates. Logical operators of this form are fault-tolerant because each qubit is acted upon by at most one gate, limiting the spread of errors, and are referred to as transversal logical operators. Identifying transversal logical operators outside the Pauli group is less well understood. Pauli operators are the first level of the Clifford hierarchy which is deeply connected to fault-tolerance and universality. In this work, we study transversal logical operators composed of single- and multi-qubit diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates. We demonstrate algorithms for identifying all transversal diagonal logical operators on a CSS code that are more general or have lower computational complexity than previous methods. We also show a method for constructing CSS codes that have a desired diagonal logical Clifford hierarchy operator implemented using single qubit phase gates. Our methods rely on representing operators composed of diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates as diagonal XP operators and this technique may have broader applications."

Here we establish a fundamental limit on the accuracy achievable with a given amount of nonequilibrium resources. The limit applies to arbitrary information processing tasks and arbitrary information processing systems subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. It is easily computable and is expressed in terms of an entropic quantity, which we name the reverse entropy, associated to a time reversal of the information processing task under consideration. The limit is achievable for all deterministic classical computations and for all their quantum extensions. As an application, we establish the optimal tradeoff between nonequilibrium and accuracy for the fundamental tasks of storing, transmitting, cloning, and erasing information. Our results set a target for the design of new devices approaching the ultimate efficiency limit, and provide a framework for demonstrating thermodynamical advantages of quantum devices over their classical counterparts. This also implies a thermodynamic benchmark to certify genuine quantum devices from their classical simulation."

The FLO-extent is defined in a similar way to the stabilizer extent known from the literature on quantum simulation using stabilizer decompositions. The FLO extent is sub-multiplicative, and the multiplicative upper bound leads to a runtime for our algorithm which doubles for each swap gate, or controlled-Z gate added to the circuit. Controlled-phase gates with different phases have lower extent, smoothly interpolating between 1 and 2. These numbers can be compared with the prior state of-the-art for this task, the runtime of which is multiplied by a factor 9 for each CZ-gate. This dramatic difference in performance is due to our use of methods we have developed to perform tasks in the FLO subtheory in a phase-sensitive way, allowing us to decompose the relevant “magic states” at the level of statevectors rather than density operators. Our results are formulated for quantum circuits, directly extending the class of quantum computations that can be simulated using current classical computers. However, the FLO subtheory also naturally represents the evolution of non-interacting Fermions, while the addition of non-FLO unitaries to the circuit can represent interactions between Fermions. We therefore expect that our results will be applicable to classical simulations of weakly interacting Fermions, with potential applications in condensed matter and quantum chemistry research. In addition to practical simulation our work is part of the ongoing effort to understand the differences between the computational power of classical and that of quantum mechanics.

However, the quality of the established channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In this work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of teleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state discrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding protocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success probability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in one-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover, our established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to show that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage for dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication capacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible information of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple proof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not provide any advantage in dense coding."

Namely, we establish out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary using a quantum neural network and for a broad class of training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training data. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the near-term prospects of QML for learning quantum dynamics, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits. Based on these insights, we propose a QML-based algorithm for simulating quantum dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and rigorously prove its resource-efficiency in terms of qubit and training data requirements. We also demonstrate the viability of this algorithm through numerical experiments, both in classical simulations and on quantum hardware.

In their very formulation, both entanglement and Bell's theorem are composite notions of nonclassicality, i.e., they require at least two parties to be meaningful.

We show that the effect of this reuse strongly depends on the family of quantum circuits that is chosen. In particular, it is maximally effective when sampling Haar random unitaries, and maximally ineffective when sampling Clifford circuits (even though the Clifford group forms a three-design). To interpolate between these two extremes, we provide an efficiently simulable family of quantum circuits inspired by a recent construction of approximate t-designs.

These are constructed from a finite-dimensional memory evolving under a set of possible linear maps, and with probabilities of outcomes determined by linear functions of the memory state. Examples of such models are given by classical hidden Markov processes, where the memory state is a probability distribution, and at each step it evolves according to a non-negative matrix, and hidden quantum Markov processes, where the memory state is a finite dimensional quantum state, and at each step it evolves according to a completely positive map. Here we show that the set of processes admitting a finite-dimensional explanation do not need to be explainable in terms of either classical probability or quantum mechanics. To wit, we exhibit families of processes that have a finite-dimensional explanation, defined manifestly by the dynamics of explicitly given GPT, but that do not admit a quantum, and therefore not even classical, explanation in finite dimension. Furthermore, we present a family of quantum processes on qubits and qutrits that do not admit a classical finite-dimensional realization, which includes examples introduced earlier by Fox, Rubin, Dharmadikari and Nadkarni as functions of infinite dimensional Markov chains, and lower bound the size of the memory of a classical model realizing a noisy version of the qubit processes."

This leads to so-called indefinite causal order processes which have been shown to provide advantages for quantum information processing. However, there have been longstanding open questions regarding the subset of practically realisable process matrices, as well as challenges in formulating their composition. We make progress on addressing such questions by connecting an important subset of process matrices, namely quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC) with so-called causal boxes which describe practical quantum information protocols in spacetime. Causal boxes are fully closed under composition and incorporate physical principles such as relativistic causality in spacetime. We first identify a notion of operational equivalence between QC-QCs and causal boxes by connecting state spaces and operations in the two formalisms. We then explicitly construct for each QC-QC an operationally equivalent causal box that satisfies certain special mathematical properties that allows the causal box to be interpreted as a process, this corresponds to a subset of causal boxes previously known as process boxes. This allows us to define composition of QC-QCs in terms of composition of causal boxes which is well-defined. We conjecture with a proof sketch that the spatiotemporal labels involved in their description can be simplified to a certain totally ordered form. Based on this, we establish through a constructive proof that every process box can be mapped to an operationally equivalent QCQC. This indicates that the subset of indefinite causal order processes realisable in a background spacetime correspond to controlled superpositions of acyclic orders, which in particular rules out processes violating so-called causal inequalities. Our results shed light on the practicality and composability questions for indefinite causal structures while introducing new physically-motivated tools for studying their applications for quantum information processing in spacetime."

The initial motivation behind the elfs process is that quantum walks can sample from electric flows, and they can hence implement this process very naturally. This yields a quantum walk algorithm for sampling from the random walk arrival distribution, which has widespread applications. It complements the existing line of quantum walk search algorithms which only return an element from the sink, but yield no insight in the distribution of the returned element. By our bound on the electric hitting time on trees, the quantum walk algorithm on trees requires quadratically fewer steps than the random walk hitting time, up to polylog factors."

A well-known issue in benchmarking is that not everything about quantum noise is learnable due to the existence of gauge freedom, leaving open the question of what information about noise is learnable and what is not, which has been unclear even for a single CNOT gate. Here we give a precise characterization of the learnability of Pauli noise channels attached to Clifford gates, showing that learnable information corresponds to the cycle space of the pattern transfer graph of the gate set, while unlearnable information corresponds to the cut space. This implies the optimality of cycle benchmarking, in the sense that it can learn all learnable information about Pauli noise. We experimentally demonstrate noise characterization of IBM's CNOT gate up to 2 unlearnable degrees of freedom, for which we obtain bounds using physical constraints. In addition, we give an attempt to characterize the unlearnable information by assuming perfect initial state preparation. However, based on the experimental data, we conclude that this assumption is inaccurate as it yields unphysical estimates, and we obtain a lower bound on state preparation noise."

The most commonly investigated approach is that of gathering all the available (quantum) data and making a final decision based on a collective measurement. However, such offline strategies are often far from practical, both in the amount of data required as well as in the complexity of the required measurement. In some settings, when the goal is quick detection, offline algorithms are not applicable at all, as they can only make a decision once all samples are received. Sequential methods offer the use of online strategies, where samples are requested on a need-to-know basis, drastically reducing the number of required samples in order to guarantee the, task specific, associated performance criteria. While extensively investigated and applied in the classical setting, we know far less about the optimal performance of such online strategies when quantum data is available. In this joint submission we present major recent progress on sequential methods for the fundamental tasks of quantum state discrimination, channel discrimination and quickest change point detection. In summary, we provide a comprehensive picture of the optimal asymptotic performance of online strategies in these settings under different performance criteria."

The frustration graph of a spin model captures the pairwise anticommutation relations between Pauli terms of its Hamiltonian in a given basis. This result captures a vast family of known free-fermion solutions. In previous work, it was shown that a free-fermion solution exists if the frustration graph is either a line graph, or (even-hole, claw)-free. The former case generalizes the celebrated Jordan-Wigner transformation and includes the exact solution to the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter case generalizes a nonlocal solution to the four-fermion model given by Fendley. Our characterization unifies these two approaches, extending generalized Jordan-Wigner solutions to the nonlocal setting and generalizing the four-fermion solution to models of arbitrary spatial dimension. Our key technical insight is the identification of a class of cycle symmetries for all models with claw-free frustration graphs. We prove that these symmetries commute, and this allows us to apply Fendley's solution method to each symmetric subspace independently. Finally, we give a physical description of the fermion modes in terms of operators generated by repeated commutation with the Hamiltonian. This connects our framework to the developing body of work on operator Krylov subspaces.

In this paper, we derive optimal lower bounds for quantum sample complexity in both the PAC and agnostic models via an information-theoretic approach. The proofs are arguably simpler, and the same ideas can potentially be used to derive optimal bounds for other problems in quantum learning theory. We then turn to a quantum analogue of the Coupon Collector problem, a classic problem from probability theory also of importance in the study of PAC learning.

As a by-product, we get a natural ensemble of pure states in arbitrarily high dimensions which are not easily (simultaneously) distinguishable, while the ensemble has close to maximal Holevo information. Second, we discover that the information-theoretic approach yields an asymptotically optimal bound for an approximation variant of the problem. Finally, we derive a sharp lower bound for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem, with the exact leading order term, via the generalized Holevo-Curlander bounds on the distinguishability of an ensemble. All the aspects of the Quantum Coupon Collector problem we study rest on properties of the spectrum of the associated Gram matrix, which may be of independent interest."

We solve this fundamental problem by introducing a framework of conic programming that unifies the theory of precision bounds for multiparameter estimates for uncorrelated and correlated measurement strategies under a common umbrella. Namely, we give precision bounds that arise from linear programs on various cones defined on a tensor product space of matrices, including a particular cone of separable matrices.

In particular, the uncorrelated measurement strategy that arises from our theory saturates the upper bound to the ultimate precision bound. Also, we show numerically that there is a strict gap between the previous efficiently computable bounds and the ultimate precision bound."

Our method uses brute force search, over the space of all encodings which map from Majorana monomials to Pauli operators, to find an encoding which optimizes a target cost function. In contrast to earlier works in this direction, our method searches over an extremely broad class of encodings which subsumes all known second quantized encodings that constitute algebra homomorphisms. In order to search over this class, we give a clear mathematical explanation of how precisely it is characterized, and how to translate this characterization into constructive search criteria. A benefit of searching over this class is that our method is able to supply fairly general optimality guarantees on solutions. A second benefit is that our method is, in principal, capable of finding more efficient representations of fermionic systems when the set of fermionic operators under consideration are faithfully represented by a smaller quotient algebra. Given the high algorithmic cost of performing the search, we adapt our method to handle translationally invariant systems that can be described by a small unit cell that is less costly. We demonstrate our method on various pairings of target fermionic operators and hardware connectivities.

Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing such computations. QEC continuously generates a continuous stream of data that decoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 MHz in superconducting quantum computers. A little known fact of QEC is that if the decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered and the quantum computer runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog problem. That is: the current leading proposal for fault-tolerant quantum computation is not scalable. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our parallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed, leading to a slow-down of the logical clock speed. However, the slow-down is now only polynomial in code size, averting the exponential slowdown. We numerically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code, showing no noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders and demonstrating the parallelization speedup."

In this paper, we develop new techniques to find classical, additive error product-state approximations for these quantities on certain families of Quantum k-Local Hamiltonians. Namely, those which are either dense, have low threshold rank, or are defined on a sparse graph that excludes a fixed minor, building on the methods and the systems studied by Brandão and Harrow, Gharibian and Kempe, and Bansal, Bravyi and Terhal. We present two main technical contributions. First, we discuss a connection between product-state approximations of local Hamiltonians and combinatorial graph property testing. We develop a series of textitweak Szemer'edi regularity lemmas for k-local Hamiltonians, built on those of Frieze and Kannan and others. We use them to develop textitconstant time sampling algorithms, and to characterize the `vertex sample complexity' of the Local Hamiltonian problem, in an analog to a classical result by Alon, de la Vega, Kannan and Karpinski. Second, we build on the information-theoretic product-state approximation techniques by Brandão and Harrow, extending their results to the free energy and to an asymmetric graph setting. We leverage this structure to define families of algorithms for the free energy at low temperatures, and new algorithms for certain sparse graph families."

Specifically, we show that the following statements hold relative to a random oracle: (a) latex mathsfBPP^QNC^BPP neq mathsfBQP. This refutes Jozsa's conjecture [Joz05] in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing. (b) latex mathsfQNC^BPP notsubseteq mathsfBPP^QNC and latex mathsfBPP^QNC notsubseteq mathsfQNC^BPP This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements. (c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth.

Specifically, we present a randomized measurement scheme modulated by the depth of a random quantum circuit in one spatial dimension. This scheme interpolates between two known classical shadows schemes based on random Pauli measurements and random Clifford measurements. We focus on the regime where depth scales logarithmically in the system size and provide evidence that this retains the desirable sample complexity properties of both extremal schemes while also being experimentally feasible. We present methods for two key tasks; estimating expectation values of certain observables from generated classical shadows and, computing upper bounds on the depth-modulated shadow norm, thus providing rigorous guarantees on the accuracy of the output estimates. We achieve our findings by bringing together tools of shadow estimation, random circuits, and tensor networks."

Originally derived for global Clifford unitaries and products of single-qubit Clifford gates, practical implementations are limited to the latter scheme for moderate numbers of qubits. Beyond local gates, the accurate implementation of very short random circuits with two-local gates is still experimentally feasible and, therefore, interesting for implementing measurements in near-term applications. In this work, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for shadow estimation using brickwork circuits with two layers of parallel two-local Haar-random (or Clifford) unitaries. Besides the construction of the classical shadow, our results give rise to sample-complexity guarantees for estimating Pauli observables. We then compare the performance of shadow estimation with brickwork circuits to the established approach using local Clifford unitaries and find improved sample complexity in the estimation of observables supported on sufficiently many qubits."
