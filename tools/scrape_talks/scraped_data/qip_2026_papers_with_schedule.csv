We use properties of a monogamy-of-entanglement game associated with the Haar measure encryption to guarantee that any state that succeeds with high probability cannot be close to maximally-entangled between the referee and either of the players, whence we can apply the decoupling principle to show that either player becomes completely uncorrelated, and therefore cannot win significantly better than random guessing.",2503.19125,,,,,,Accepted,Archishna Bhattacharyya,28 January,13:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,A Quantum Approach For Reducing Communications in Classical Secure Computations with Long Outputs,,Jiayu Zhang,Zhongguancun Laboratory,"How could quantum cryptography help us achieve what are not achievable in classical cryptography? In this work we study the classical cryptographic problem that two parties would like to perform secure computations with long outputs. As a basic primitive and example, we first consider the following problem which we call secure function sampling with long outputs: suppose $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ is a public, efficient classical function, where $m$ is big; Alice would like to sample $x$ from its domain and sends $f(x)$ to Bob; what Bob knows should be no more than $f(x)$ even if it behaves maliciously. Classical cryptography, like FHE and succinct arguments [Gen09,Kil92,HW15], allows us to achieve this task within communication complexity $O(n+m)$; could we achieve this task with communication complexity independent of $m$?

In this work, we first design a quantum cryptographic protocol that achieves secure function sampling with approximate security, within $O(n)$ communication (omitting the dependency on the security parameter and error tolerance). We also prove the classical impossibility using techniques in [HW15], which means that our protocol indeed achieves a type of quantum advantage. Building on the secure function sampling protocol, we further construct protocols for general secure two-party computations [Yao86,GB01] with approximate security, with communication complexity only depending on the input length and the targeted security. In terms of the assumptions, we construct protocols for these problems assuming only the existence of collapsing hash functions [Unr16]; what's more, we also construct a classical-channel protocol for these problems additionally assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [BCMVV,BKVV].",2310.05213,,,,,,Accepted,Jiayu Zhang,27 January,15:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Fault Tolerance by Construction,,Benjamin Rodatz;Boldizsár Poór;Maximilian Rüsch;Aleks Kissinger,University of Oxford;University of Oxford;University of Oxford;University of Oxford,"A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic transformations.

To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification.

To utilise fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. We show that this rewriting system is complete, meaning that two circuits are fault-equivalent if and only if one can be transformed into the other using fault-equivalent ZX rewrites. Enabled by our framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation framework.","2506.17181,https://maximilianruesch.de/scientific/msc-thesis/msc-thesis.pdf",,,,,,Accepted,Benjamin Rodatz,30 January,15:00,30

Moreover, we generalize this result to hold for threshold verifiers, where the parallel repeated verifier accepts if and only if at least t of the executions are accepted (for some threshold t). Prior to this work, these results were known only when the cheating prover is assumed to be classical.

We also prove a similar result for three-message private-coin arguments. Previously, Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen (STOC 2024) proved such a parallel repetition result in the more general setting of quantum protocols, where the communication may be quantum. We consider only protocols where the verifier is classical, but obtain a more simplified analysis, and for the more general setting of threshold verifiers.",2506.02277,,,,,,Accepted,Andrew Huang,29 January,15:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Quantum circuit lower bounds in the magic hierarchy,,Natalie Parham,Columbia University,"We introduce the \emph{magic hierarchy}, a quantum circuit model that alternates between arbitrary-sized Clifford circuits and constant-depth circuits with two-qubit gates ($\textsf{QNC}^0$). This model unifies existing circuit models, such as $\QACZF$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements. Despite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.

We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that certain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits consisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states include ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and nonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of stabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single state in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these circuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer code. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply \emph{classical} circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory. 

More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight how the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit complexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.",https://arxi,,,,,,Accepted,Natalie Parham,28 January,13:30,30

In this work, we show that \emph{every} pure hypothesis state can be certified using only $O(n^2)$ single-qubit measurements applied to $O(n)$ copies of the lab state. Prior to our work, it was not known whether even subexponentially many single-qubit measurements could suffice to certify arbitrary states. This resolves the main open question of Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (FOCS 2024, QIP 2024).

Our algorithm also showcases the power of \emph{adaptive measurements}: within each copy of the lab state,  previous measurement outcomes dictate how subsequent qubit measurements are made. We show that the adaptivity is necessary, by proving an exponential lower bound on the number of copies needed for any nonadaptive single-qubit measurement algorithm.",2506.11355,,,,,Best Student Paper,AcceptedAsPlenaryAndBestStudentPaper,William He,28 January,10:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding,,Andrew C. Yuan,"University of Maryland, College Park","Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks.
Motivations may include concatenating codes, embedding low-density parity check (LDPC) codes into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of parity checks.
During this embedding, it is essential that the modified code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original code. 
However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general.
Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes.

We prove that at a sufficiently high temperature that is independent of the system size, the Gibbs state is a probabilistic mixture of fermionic Gaussian states. This forms the basis of an efficient classical algorithm to prepare the Gibbs state by sampling from a distribution of fermionic Gaussian states.

A ``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, in particular showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such as CVQC.",,,,,,,Accepted,Kabir Tomer,27 January,16:30,30

To achieve an $\epsilon$-approximation, it suffices to have a catalyst state of size polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$.  This implies that $\mathsf{QNC}^0_f/\mathsf{qpoly}$ admits a finite universal gate set consisting of Clifford+$T$. In particular, there are catalytic constant $T$-depth circuits that approximate multi-qubit Toffoli, adder, and quantum Fourier transform arbitrarily well. We also show that the catalyst state can be prepared in time polynomial in  $\log (1/\epsilon)$.",2506.15147,,,,,,Accepted,,,,

We present advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e.\ unitary channels over a line of N quantum systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality radius r: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more than r. We prove that, for N ≥ 4r + 1, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques, leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C* algebras.",2506.22219,,,,,,Accepted,Augustin Vanrietvelde,26 January,13:30,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms,,Uma Girish,Columbia University,"Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between BQP and BPP. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise.

Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: DQC_k algorithms, where k qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and 1/2-BQP algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of DQC_k, 1/2-BQP and BQP algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that the 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation problems require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the DQC_1 and 1/2-BQP models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.",,,,,,,Accepted,Uma Girish,26 January,14:00,30

Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates. 

   In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of \emph{constant-time} quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future. 

   Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. 
   Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC^0}$.

Modelling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typically, truncating their infinite-dimensional state space or restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to these simple classes, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional spaces. Can we trust  results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to capture real effects?

We solve this outstanding problem, showing that these effective descriptions do correctly capture the physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contributions are twofold: first, we prove that any physical bosonic unitary evolution can be accurately approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; second, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, show that polynomial Hamiltonians generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and lead to a bosonic Solovay-Kitaev theorem.",2501.13857,,,,,,Accepted,Francesco Arzani,27 January,13:00,30

However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in both space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state distillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our scheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of 3×10^(−7), using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a noise bias of η ≳ 5×10^6 and a phase-flip noise rate of 0.1%. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude relative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than two orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation. Moreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for biased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at a more modest noise bias of η ≳ 80, at the cost of a slightly increased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high physical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose circuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is based on unfolding the X stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum Reed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than the logical level, and is therefore referred to as unfolded distillation.",https://arxi,,,,,,Accepted,Diego Ruiz,27 January,15:00,30

We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model.

Concretely, the KLVY compiler (STOC'23) maps any multi-prover game to an interactive single-prover protocol, using quantum homomorphic encryption. A crucial security property of such compilers is quantum soundness, which ensures a dishonest quantum prover cannot exceed the original game's quantum value.
For practical cryptographic implementations, this soundness must be quantitative, providing concrete bounds, rather than merely asymptotic. While quantitative quantum soundness has been established for the KLVY compiler in the bipartite case, it has only been shown asymptotically for multipartite games. This is a significant gap, as multipartite nonlocality exhibits phenomena with no bipartite analogue, and the difficulty of enforcing space-like separation makes single-device compilation especially compelling. This work closes this gap by showing the quantitative quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler for all multipartite nonlocal games.

In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP*=RE shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP* is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges.

In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP*-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable.

However, standard information-theoretic analyses do not consider the actual computational complexity involved in performing certain tasks. Here, we address this issue within the realm of entanglement theory, finding that accounting for computational efficiency substantially changes what can be achieved using entangled resources. We consider two key figures of merit: the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost. These measures quantify the optimal rates of entangled bits that can be extracted from or used to dilute many identical copies of 
n-qubit bipartite pure states, using computationally efficient local operations and classical communication. We demonstrate that computational entanglement measures diverge significantly from their information-theoretic counterparts.
While the information-theoretic distillable entanglement is determined by the von Neumann entropy of the reduced state, we show that the min-entropy governs the computationally efficient setting. On the other hand, computationally efficient entanglement dilution requires maximal consumption of entangled bits, even for nearly unentangled states.
Furthermore, in the worst-case scenario, even when an efficient description of the state exists and is fully known, one gains no advantage over state-agnostic protocols.

We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP∗ except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement instead, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP∗ = RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP∗ = RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al.

We show that both MIP∗ and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP∗ and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP∗ = RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound.

Yet designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract that information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. 
    
One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting and show a number of new information-computation gaps for quantum learning. 
    
We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.

We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.

QIP,2026,contributed,Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness,,Eric Anschuetz,Caltech,"We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for Lipschitz quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm---such as the classical shadows algorithm---for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. Our results are unconditional.

To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum p-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches (up to constant factors) the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical p-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum p-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical p-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.",2505.00087,,,,,,Accepted,Eric Anschuetz,27 January,16:30,30

The complexity measure that we consider is a smoothed version of the algorithmic entropy notion introduced by Gács [Gác01].

A key technical step in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is to show that the existence of EFI pairs is equivalent to the existence of non-uniform single-copy secure pseudorandom state generators (nu 1-PRS).

These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open. 

We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming (sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also gives the first standard-model separation between classical and collapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open problem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional security relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model construction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations (permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs involving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular, obfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is \emph{full-domain}, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this object from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions.",https://arxi,,,,,,Accepted,Omri Shmueli,29 January,15:30,30

The new inequalities are saturated by tensor network states, whose structure mimics the corresponding network of connectors. Some tight connectors are furthermore ``fully self-testing'', which implies that the QBI they generate through contractions can only be maximized with such a tensor network state and specific measurement operators (modulo local isometries). We provide large analytic families of tight, fully self-testing connectors that allow the generation, via contraction, of N-partite QBIs with a ratio between the maximum quantum and classical values that grows exponentially with N.

These models represent causal relationships through directed graphs, with vertices and edges denoting systems and transformations within a theory. Most studies focus on acyclic causal graphs, where well-defined probability rules and powerful graph-theoretic properties like the d-separation theorem apply. However, understanding complex feedback processes and exotic fundamental scenarios with causal loops requires cyclic causal models, where such results do not generally hold. While progress has been made in classical cyclic causal models, challenges remain in uniquely fixing probability distributions and identifying graph-separation properties applicable in general cyclic models. In cyclic quantum scenarios, existing frameworks have focussed on a subset of possible cyclic causal scenarios, with graph-separation properties yet unexplored. This work proposes a framework applicable to all consistent quantum and classical cyclic causal models on finite-dimensional systems. We address these challenges by introducing a robust probability rule and a novel graph-separation property, p-separation, which we prove to be sound and complete for all such models. Our approach maps cyclic causal models to acyclic ones with post-selection, leveraging the post-selected quantum teleportation protocol. We characterize these protocols and their success probabilities along the way.

Instead, we encode the optimization problem into the dynamics of a physical system and coherently simulate the time evolution. 
    Our first two algorithms can find local optima of a differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by simulating either classical or quantum dynamics with friction via a time-dependent Hamiltonian. We show that for the benchmark problem of optimizing a locally quadratic objective function, these methods require a total of $O(N^2\kappa^2/h_x^2\epsilon)$ queries to a phase oracle to find an $\epsilon$-approximate local optimum, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the Hessian matrix and $h_x$ is the discretization spacing. In contrast, we show that methods based on gradient descent require $O(N^{3/2}(1/\epsilon)^{\kappa \log(3)/4})$ queries.  This corresponds to an exponential separation between the query upper bounds for the benchmark problem.
    Our third algorithm can find the global optimum of $f$ by preparing a classical low-temperature thermal state via simulation of the classical Liouvillian operator associated with the Nosé Hamiltonian. We use results from the quantum thermodynamics literature to bound the thermalization time for the discrete system. Additionally, we analyze barren plateau effects that commonly plague quantum optimization algorithms and observe that our approach is vastly less sensitive to this problem than standard gradient-based optimization.

As near-term quantum devices are error-prone, it is important to design error-resistant algorithms. Apart from device errors, other unexpected factors could also affect the algorithm, such as careless human read-out error, or even a malicious hacker deliberately altering the measurement results. Thus, we want our algorithm to work even in the worst case when things go against our favor. 

We consider the practical setting of single-copy measurements and propose the $\gamma$-adversarial corruption model where an imaginary adversary can arbitrarily change $\gamma$-fraction of the measurement outcomes. This is stronger than the $\gamma$-bounded SPAM noise model, where the post-measurement state changes by at most $\gamma$ in trace distance. Under our stronger model of corruption, we design an algorithm using non-adaptive measurements that can learn an unknown rank-$r$ state up to $\tilde{O}(\gamma\sqrt{r})$ in trace distance, provided that the number of copies is sufficiently large. We further prove an information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(\gamma\sqrt{r})$ for non-adaptive measurements, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithm. 
Our upper and lower bounds also hold for quantum state testing, where the goal is to test whether an unknown state is equal to a given state or far from it.

Our results are intriguingly optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. For general states, the error is dimension-dependent and $\gamma\sqrt{d}$ in the worst case, meaning that only corrupting a very small fraction ($1/\sqrt{d}$) of the outcomes could totally destroy any non-adaptive learning algorithm.

Assuming each pair of qubits interacts with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ strength, time-dependent all-to-all Hamiltonians can simulate arbitrary all-to-all quantum circuits, performing quantum computation in time proportional to the circuit depth. In this work, we show that this naive correspondence is far from optimal: all-to-all Hamiltonians can process information on much faster timescales.

Our first main result establishes that any two-qubit gate can be simulated by all-to-all Hamiltonians on $N$ qubits in time $\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ (up to factor $N^{\delta}$ with an arbitrarily small constant $\delta>0$), with polynomially small error $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$. Immediate consequences include:  
1) Certain $\mathrm{O}(N)$-qubit unitaries, such as the multiply-controlled Toffoli gate, can be realized in $\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ time.  
2) Globally entangled states such as the GHZ and W states of $\mathrm{O}(N)$ qubits can be prepared in $\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ time.  
3) Any depth-$D$ circuit on $N_{\rm d}$ qubits can be simulated in arbitrarily short time $T=\mathrm{O}(DN_{\rm d}/N)$, inversely proportional to the space overhead $N/N_{\rm d}$.  
4) The existing Lieb-Robinson bound for strong power-law interactions $H_{ij}\sim r_{ij}^{-\gamma}$ in spatial dimension $\mathsf{d}>\gamma$ is tight, requiring time $T=\Omega(N^{\frac{\gamma}{\mathsf{d}}-1})$ for information to propagate.  

Our second main result shows that any depth-$D$ quantum circuit can be simulated in time $T=\mathrm{O}(D/\sqrt{N})$ with constant space overhead, with error $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$ for almost all inputs. This “optimistic” simulation may suffice for practical purposes: for instance, building on prior work, we demonstrate that Shor’s factoring algorithm can be implemented by $\mathrm{O}(\sqrt{N})$-time Hamiltonian evolution with constant space overhead.

In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce addressable logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act only on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling from low-rate to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes.

In this work, we construct the first quantum codes to support transversally addressable non-Clifford gates. Concretely, given any three logical qubits across one or multiple codeblocks, one can execute the logical CCZ on those qubits via a depth-one physical circuit of CCZ gates. We present a simple, explicit construction based on Reed-Solomon codes that is nearly asymptotically good, and a more involved, asymptotically good construction based on transitive, iso-orthogonal algebraic geometry codes.

We thoroughly address this problem for the case of qubit states. Principally, we compute the distillation channel that is asymptotically optimal in the limit of a large number of input qubit states and compute the resulting infidelity (one minus fidelity) between the output qubit state and the desired pure state. We show that this infidelity is closely related to a resource known as purity of coherence, a quantity obtained from the Right Logarithmic Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric. We thus demonstrate an operational meaning for purity of coherence as the quantity whose monotonicity on time-translation invariant channels sets the strongest asymptotic bound on the capability of coherence distillation for qubit states. For a special choice of input and output state, we additionally investigate a number of extensions of this primary result. In particular, we present numerical schemes to produce the exact optimal distillation protocol for a fixed value of $N$, extend the computation of the optimal protocol and the minimum infidelity to the $1/N^2$ and $1/N^3$ orders, estimate the amount of purity of coherence that is dissipated by the optimal distillation protocol, and compute the mathematical behavior of the protocol more precisely in the low-noise and high-noise limits.",,,,,,,Accepted,Sujay Kazi,27 January,13:00,30

A key task in this area is quantum process tomography, which seeks to learn unitary transformations of quantum states efficiently. Efficient process tomography would be highly valuable: for instance, learning an unknown natural process could enable its efficient implementation and simulation on a quantum computer.

However, learning arbitrary unitary operators is generally prohibitively expensive, with several sample- and time-complexity lower bounds showing the task is intractable. Thus, work typically focuses on more structured classes of operators when computational efficiency is desired. 

Two especially important such classes are bosonic and fermionic Gaussian unitaries. 
These operators have compact parametrizations, rich algebraic structure, and enough expressiveness to capture many relevant physical processes. As a result, they are ubiquitous in quantum information theory.

In this work, we advance the learning theory of bosonic and fermionic unitaries in two ways:
(1) We give the first time-efficient algorithm to learn bosonic Gaussian unitaries. The complexity of the algorithm scales polynomially in the number of modes, a total photon number bound (which is critical in defining an energy-constrained distance measure), and a squeezing parameter which captures how much the operator increases the mean energy of a vacuum state.
(2) We give a first-of-its-kind algorithm to learn fermionic unitaries prepared with at most t non-Gaussian gates. Our algorithm scales polynomially in the number of modes and exponentially in t, and we argue that this scaling is optimal up to polynomial factors.

Both algorithms produce an output whose distance to the input unitary is small in the worst-case (diamond) distance.

Garg et al.~showed that if one has just $c = 2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\eps^2} + \frac{1}{\eps^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\textnormal{avg}} = q$ from $\dtv{p_{\textnormal{avg}}}{q} > \eps$. This nearly matches the optimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\eps^2}$).

Besides optimally improving this result (and generalizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we study the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical \emph{quantum} states.  Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional hypothesis state~$\sigma$, and given just a \emph{single} copy ($c = 1$) of each state $\rho_1, \dots, \rho_T$, one can distinguish $\rho_{\textnormal{avg}} = \sigma$ from $\Dtr{\rho_{\textnormal{avg}}}{\sigma} > \eps$ provided $T \gg d/\eps^2$.

As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting.

The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which is comparably small. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.",,,,,,,Accepted,Joao Basso,26 January,16:00,30

By establishing connections to the theory of fault-tolerant logical gates, we show the emergence of LRM state families from quantum error-correcting codes. Then, denoting phases whose ground states all exhibit LRM as LRM phases, we prove concrete conditions under which a topological order constitutes an LRM phase, with prominent examples including certain non-Abelian topological orders. Finally, from the computational complexity perspective, we discuss the intrinsic quantumness of long-range magic from e.g. preparation and learning perspectives, and formulate a ""no low-energy trivial magic"" (NLTM) conjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context for which our LRM results suggest a promising route. We also show how correlation functions can serve as diagnostics for LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by correlation properties.

The fastest known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm, and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these ``sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger $k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack.

At the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the Clifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries.
Previous understanding of this commutant has been limited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits $n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our first result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and computes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$.

For coherently accessing classical memories of size 2^n, our protocol consumes only poly(n) fault-tolerant quantum resources (logical gates, logical qubits, quantum error correction cycles, etc.), avoiding the need to perform active error correction on all Ω(2^n) components of the QRAM device. This is the first rigorous conceptual demonstration that a specialized, noisy QRAM device could be useful for implementing a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm. In fact, the fidelity of the device can be as low as 1/poly(n). The protocol queries the noisy QRAM device poly(n) times to prepare a sequence of n-qubit QRAM resource states, which are moved to a general-purpose poly(n)-size processor to be encoded into a QEC code, distilled, and fault-tolerantly teleported into the computation. To aid this protocol, we develop a new gate-efficient streaming version of quantum purity amplification that matches the optimal sample complexity in a wide range of parameters and is therefore of independent interest.
 
The exponential reduction in fault-tolerant quantum resources comes at the expense of an exponential quantity of purely classical complexity---each of the n iterations of the protocol requires adaptively updating the 2^n-size classical dataset and providing the noisy QRAM device with access to the updated dataset at the next iteration. We show that this classical operation can be parallelized to poly(n) classical circuit depth, but only in a model where classical sparse matrix-vector multiplication for 2^n-dimensional vectors can be as well.

These thresholds are important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful quantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact that independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any permutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output states can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the symmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient algorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a permutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent information values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100 channel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically relevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure channel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing channel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their quantum capacities.

Our main technical contribution is a \emph{quantum agnostic boosting} protocol which converts a ``weak'' agnostic learner (which outputs a \emph{parity state} $|\phi\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt}/\textsf{poly}(n)$) into a ``strong'' learner (which outputs a sum of parity states $|\phi'\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi'|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt} - \varepsilon$).  

Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain the first ``near'' polynomial-time $n^{O(\log \log n)}$ algorithm for learning $\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$ circuits (consisting of $\textsf{AND}$, $\textsf{OR}$, $\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in the uniform quantum $\textsf{PAC}$ model using quantum examples.  Classically, the analogue of efficient learning  depth-$3$ circuits (and even depth-$2$ circuits) in the uniform $\textsf{PAC}$ model has been a longstanding open question in computational learning theory.

Prior works have shown that average-case hardness of sampling follows from certain unproven conjectures about the hardness of computing output probabilities, such as the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture (PGC), which states that $e^{-n\log{n}-n-O(\log n)}$ additive-error estimates to the output probability of most random BosonSampling experiments are $\#P$-hard. Prior works have only shown weaker average-case hardness results that do not imply sampling hardness. Proving these conjectures has become a central question in quantum complexity.

In this work, we show that $e^{-n\log n-n-O(n^\delta)}$ additive-error estimates to output probabilities of most random BosonSampling experiments are $\#P$-hard for any $\delta>0$, exponentially improving on prior work. In the process, we circumvent all known barrier results for proving PGC. The remaining hurdle to prove PGC is now “merely” to show that the $O(n^\delta)$ in the exponent can be improved to $O(\log n).$ We also obtain an analogous result for Random Circuit Sampling.

We then show, for the first time, a hardness of average-case classical sampling result for  BosonSampling, under an anticoncentration conjecture. Specifically, we prove the impossibility of multiplicative-error sampling from random BosonSampling experiments with probability $1-2^{-\tilde{\mathstrut O}(N^{1/3})}$ for input size $N$, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. This exponentially improves upon the state-of-the-art. To do this, we introduce new proof techniques which tolerate exponential loss in the worst-to-average-case reduction.

This quantity
 accounts for both deviation from the target gate and leakage out of the code space. It is subadditive under gate composition, enabling simple circuit analysis, and can be bounded using matrix elements of physical unitaries between (approximate) logical basis states.

As a case study, we study the composable logical gate error of linear optics implementations of Paulis and Cliffords in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We find that the logical gate error for implementations of Pauli gates depends linearly on the squeezing parameter. This means that their accuracy increases monotonically with the amount of squeezing. In contrast, implementations of some Clifford gates retain a constant logical gate error even in the limit of infinite squeezing. This highlights that results derived for ideal GKP codes do not always translate to physically realistic approximate codes.

We propose a way of sidestepping this no-go result in hybrid qubit-oscillator systems with Gaussian, multi-qubit, and qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. We propose implementations of logical gates using two oscillators and three qubits, whose logical gate error is bounded by a linear function of the squeezing parameter and scales polynomially with the number of encoded qubits.",,,,,,,Accepted,Lukas Brenner,30 January,09:00,30

In quantum computing, the usual answer is that, if we can perform a circuit implementing a unitary $U$, we can also implement its variants $U^\dagger$, $\controlled U$, and $\controlled U^\dagger$ equally as efficiently. These four operations are the ""usual"" suite of oracles we mean when we model access to a subroutine. We interrogate these choices and investigate how changing our access model to $U$ affects the tractability of its computational problems.

This submission is a collection of three preprints on possible models of oracle access.

1. In the most limited setting, we only have access to $U$: this is the natural model for metrology, sensing, learning, and other experimental contexts. We show that, unlike in the usual model, the generic Grover speedups for search and estimation, ubiquitous throughout quantum algorithms, cannot be achieved in this setting.

2. In the usual model as well as in general, we show that controlled unitary oracles have a surprisingly limited role. We prove they are not helpful for a large class of problems: problems which are invariant up to global phase, i.e. problems which are a about $U$ as a unitary channel.

3. In the full setting, we are given a circuit implementing $U$: this model is natural for algorithms on scalable quantum computers. We show that the usual suite of oracles is not enough to characterize the strength of this model, by giving a natural problem which cannot be solved efficiently without queries to $U^*$ or $U^T$---which can be implemented from any circuit for $U$.

Previously, the main quantum query lower bound methods were the polynomial method, the adversary method, and the multiplicative adversary method, and their relative powers were well understood. In this work, we situate the compressed oracle technique within this established landscape, by showing that it is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method. To accomplish this, we introduce a simplified restriction of the multiplicative adversary method, the MLADV method, that remains powerful enough to capture the polynomial method and exhibit a strong direct product theorem, but is much simpler to reason about. We show that the compressed oracle technique is also captured by the MLADV method.

Recent quantum algorithms have demonstrated that the logarithm of the determinant of sparse, well-conditioned, positive matrices can be approximated to $\varepsilon$-relative accuracy in time polylogarithmic in the dimension~$N$, specifically in time~$\mathrm{poly}(\mathrm{log}(N), s, \kappa, 1/\varepsilon)$, where $s$ is the sparsity and $\kappa$ the condition number of the input matrix.
We provide a simple dequantization of these techniques that preserves the polylogarithmic dependence on the dimension, at the cost of worse scaling in the sparsity, condition number, and accuracy. Our classical algorithm runs in time~$\mathrm{poly}\mathrm{log}(N)\cdot s^{O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log \kappa/\varepsilon)}$ which constitutes an exponential improvement over previous classical algorithms in certain parameter regimes.

In addition, we prove $\mathsf{DQC}1$-completeness for estimating specific spectral sums such as the trace of the inverse and the trace of matrix powers with analogous parameter scalings as the quantum algorithms for the log-determinant in the case of log-local Hamiltonians.
The latter solves a main open problem posed by Cade and Montanaro (TQC 2018) and is closely related to the complexity of Schatten $p$-norm estimation.
It further shows that the parameter scalings of known quantum algorithms are not achievable classically, assuming~$\mathsf{BPP}\subsetneq\mathsf{DQC}1$.

Further, we also consider a different input model where instead of a classical description of a sparse matrix, we are given a block-encoding of it and analyze the complexity of spectral sum estimation in this model.
We obtain $\mathsf{DQC}1$-completeness of estimating $\mathrm{tr}[f(A)]$ in this model in a very general way, in particular whenever $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are Lipschitz continuous with bounded Lipschitz constants.

In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction. We show that all metastable states exhibit universal structures that parallel true quantum Gibbs states: an area law of mutual information and a local Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply.

In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times.

The power of our framework extends beyond Pauli measurements: We prove that Pauli measurements are near-optimal among single-qubit measurements, and further prove tight lower bounds for adaptive $k$-outcome measurements.","2502.18170, 2507.22001",,,,,,Accepted,Jayadev Acharya,30 January,13:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness,,Alexander Zlokapa;Bobak T. Kiani;Eric R. Anschuetz,MIT;Bowdoin College;Caltech,"We provide a framework for average-case quantum complexity by showing that glassiness obstructs a natural family of quantum algorithms. Glassiness --- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a disordered, slow-mixing phase --- is known to imply hardness for stable classical algorithms; for example, constant-time Langevin dynamics or message-passing fail for random $k$-SAT and max-cut problems in a glassy parameter regime. We present comparable results in the quantum setting with the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}[rightmargin=7em]
    \item \emph{Quantum optimal transport view of glassiness.} We show that the standard notion of quantum glassiness in physics implies that the Gibbs state is decomposed into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. We prove this implies lower bounds on the quantum Wasserstein complexity of channels from non-glassy to glassy states.
    \item \emph{Structural argument for hardness.} We define \emph{stable quantum algorithms} in terms of Lipschitz temperature dependence. We prove that constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational algorithms are stable and hence fail to capture the clustered geometry of the Gibbs state, yielding a geometrically interpretable algorithmic obstruction. Contrary to prior Lindbladian runtime lower bounds that only apply to evolution from worst-case initial states, our results hold even when starting from the maximally mixed state.
\end{itemize}
At a technical level, our techniques (based on channel complexity) differ significantly from classical probabilistic approaches due to the sign problem in the absence of a known eigenbasis. This allows our average-case hardness results to apply to non-commuting, non-stoquastic quantum Hamiltonians. As an example, we show the average-case hardness of random 3-local Hamiltonians: the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients. To obtain this result, we compute the full replica symmetry breaking solution of the general $p$-local Pauli Hamiltonian ensemble via the replica trick, a non-rigorous but widely used method in statistical physics. The system's phase diagram is richer than its classical (Ising $p$-spin) and fermionic (SYK) analogues, which either always or never have a glassy phase; instead, the Pauli ensemble has a glassy phase only below some constant value of $p$, confirming the phase diagram predicted by prior finite-size numerical analyses.",,,,,,,Accepted,Alexander Zlokapa,30 January,11:30,30

Despite significant progress, realizing generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time overhead, scaling as $O(N)$ for $N$ fermionic modes. 
Here we present a method for faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of $O(\log(N))$ in the worst case, and $O(1)$ for circuits with additional structure, including important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform.
This exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings.
We apply this technique to achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian simulation of the sparse Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev model and periodic materials, as well as free-fermion state-preparation.
Moreover, we show that the algorithms themselves can be adapted to use only the $O(1)$-overhead structures to further reduce resource overhead.
These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.

We present a suite of methods to do matrix arithmetics---with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian---using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this Hamiltonian block encoding, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits.

We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also develop an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit.

Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, wherein the approximation holds over the domain of interest, while the polynomial is upper bounded by the target function on the entire unit interval.

When applied to quantum simulation, our methods inherit the commutator scaling of product formulas, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each step. To illustrate this feature, we present a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, covering systems studied recently in quantum chemistry. Our simulation attains a commutator scaling in step count, while the gate cost per step remains comparable to that of more advanced algorithms.

Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the Gibbs expectation value is PSPACE-complete.
We also show that the related problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the microcanonical expectation value is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.",2507.00405,,,,,,Accepted,Dhruv Devulapalli,30 January,13:30,30

In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such ""optimistic quantum circuits"" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth O(log(n/ϵ)) for tunable error parameter ϵ, uses n total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by ϵ on all input states except an ϵ-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions, the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only 2n + O(n/log n) total qubits. Additionally, we apply our reduction technique to yield an approximate QFT with well-controlled error on all inputs; it is the first to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of O(log (n/ϵ)) with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits.

QIP,2026,contributed,A New Quantum Linear System Algorithm Beyond the Condition Number and Its Application to Solving Multivariate Polynomial Systems,,Jianqiang Li,Rice University,"Given a matrix $A$ of dimension  $M\times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state $\ket{\vec{y}}$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$. Existing QLS algorithms typically have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with the inverse precision. However, these algorithms often overlook structural properties of the input vector $\vec{b}$, despite the fact that its alignment with the eigenspaces of $A$ can significantly affect performance. In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. Let the sparsity of a matrix be defined as the maximum number of nonzero entries in any row or column. The runtime of our algorithm depends polynomially on the sparsity $\s$ of the augmented matrix $H = [A ,  -\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter
$$
ET = \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2 \cdot d_i,
$$
where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$-norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. To further reduce the runtime for certain applications we introduce a structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$. Unlike \emph{left} preconditioning methods, which transform the system to $DA\vec{z} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a \emph{right} rescaling matrix, reformulating the linear system as $A D \vec{z} = \vec{b}$.


This combination of an instance-aware QLS algorithm and a rescaling strategy reopens the possibilities for achieving superpolynomial quantum speedups in various domains, such as nonlinear differential equations and polynomial systems. As a application, we develop a new quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial systems in regimes where previous QLS-based methods fail. Our results yield a new end-to-end algorithmic framework, grounded in our new QLS algorithm, that applies to a broad class of problems. In particular, we apply our approach to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special case of a polynomial system. Given a graph, the MIS problem asks for finding the largest subset of vertices such that no two vertices in the subset share an edge. We provide a detailed runtime analysis and show that, under certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for the MIS problem runs in polynomial time. While no classical algorithms have been developed under these conditions, a promising feature of our quantum algorithm is that its runtime explicitly depends on the structure of the independent sets in the input graph.",,,,,,,Accepted,,,,

This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost. This, to our knowledge, is the first example of Lindbladian fast forwarding, which shares a fundamentally different mechanism from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics.

This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the space of all possible operators in the Hilbert space, which is doubly exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer notion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator growth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any physical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas’’ formula for the FMI in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator $A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of all higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point OTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to freeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of recent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify universal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs in a variety of chaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains, which indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a generic feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic behavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary designs, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space but remains localized in operator space.

In this work we show that such sharp separations extend far beyond the two-copy
regime: for every prime k we construct explicit learning tasks of degree k, which are
exponentially hard with (k − 1)-copy measurements but efficiently solvable with k-
copy measurements. Our protocols are not only sample-efficient but also realizable
with shallow circuits. Extending further, we show that such finite-degree tasks ex-

Previous work by Blocki, Holman, and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either parallelism or spookiness respectively; we show that these two resources can enable even more efficient guarantees when utilized in tandem. Specifically, we show that with parallelism and spookiness, a line graph of length $\ell$ can be pebbled in time $2\ell$ (which is exactly optimal) and space $\leq 2.47\log \ell$.

We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025) to obtain significant concrete improvements on previous implementations of the underlying arithmetic (Ragavan and Vaikuntanathan, CRYPTO 2024). For example, we can factor 4096-bit integers $N$ using a mod $N$ multiplication depth of 328, which outperforms the 680 required of previous variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Eker{\aa} and G{\""a}rtner (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025) for Shor's algorithm.

First, we consider the role of energy conservation in the setting where the Hamiltonian $H$ is completely known. There, we show that energy-conserving pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) exist for random local commuting Hamiltonians, assuming quantum-secure one-way functions exist. However, we also prove that energy-conserving PRUs do not exist for some local translation-invariant Hamiltonians, even in one-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we show that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a family of Hamiltonians is undecidable. Second, we consider Hamiltonian time dynamics itself when there is incomplete knowledge of $H$. In this setting, we prove that random unitaries $e^{-iHt}$ generated from any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians $H$ cannot form approximate unitary designs or PRUs. This barrier vanishes when we relax locality: we construct an ensemble of polylog-local Hamiltonians $H$ that generates short-time dynamics which form both a unitary design and a PRU.

It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architecture and connectivity, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay (consistent with log n depth convergence).

If the rate vanishes asymptotically sufficiently rapidly, slightly sub-exponential decoding algorithms are known. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical code at constant rate—the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any coding rate, would immediately imply a breakthrough in cryptography.

More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and decision.

When considering a Bell test involving three parties, we may even find a remarkable situation where the nonlocality in two bipartite subsystems forces the remaining bipartite subsystem to exhibit nonlocality. This intriguing effect, dubbed nonlocality transitivity, was first identified in the non-quantum non-signaling world in 2011. However, whether such transitivity could manifest within quantum theory has remained unresolved—until now. Here, we provide the first affirmative answer to this open problem at the level of quantum states, thereby showing that there exists a quantum-realizable notion of nonlocality transitivity. Specifically, by leveraging the possibility of Bell-inequality violation by tensoring, we analytically construct a pair of nonlocal bipartite states such that simultaneously realizing them in a tripartite system induces nonlocality in the remaining bipartite subsystem. En route to showing this, we also prove that multiple copies of the W-state marginals uniquely determine the global compatible state, thus establishing another instance when the parts determine the whole. Surprisingly, the nonlocality transitivity of quantum states also occurs among the reduced states of Haar-random three-qutrit pure states. We further show that the transitivity of quantum steering can already be demonstrated with the marginals of a three-qubit W state, showing again another noteworthy difference between the two forms of quantum correlations.

QIP,2026,merged_contributed,The debiased Keyl's algorithm: a new unbiased estimator for full state tomography,,Angelos Pelecanos;Jack Spilecki;John Wright,UC Berkeley;UC Berkeley;UC Berkeley,"In the problem of quantum state tomography, one is given $n$ copies of an unknown rank-$r$ mixed state $\rho \in \C^{d \times d}$ and asked to produce an estimator $\widehat{\brho}$ of $\rho$ which is close to it. One of the most basic and useful properties a statistical estimator can have is that of being \emph{unbiased}, meaning that $\widehat{\brho}$ is equal to the true state $\rho$ in expectation.
    
Unfortunately, of the three estimators for tomography which are known to be either sample-optimal or almost sample-optimal, namely Keyl's algorithm~\cite{Key06} and the two tomography algorithms from~\cite{HHJ+16}, none of them produce unbiased estimators. This situation has recently been highlighted as a bottleneck in several important tomographic applications~\cite{CLL24a,CLL24b}.
    
In this work, we present the \emph{debiased Keyl's algorithm}, the first estimator for full state tomography which is both unbiased and sample-optimal. Our algorithm is the result of taking Keyl's algorithm and carefully modifying it in order to correct for its bias. In addition, we derive an explicit formula for the second moment of our estimator which is simple and easy to use. Using it, we show the following applications.
\begin{itemize}
        \item[$\circ$] We show that $n = O(rd/\epsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to learn a rank-$r$ mixed state $\rho \in \C^{d \times d}$ to trace distance error $\epsilon$. This gives a new proof of the main result of~\cite{OW16} and matches the lower bound of~\cite{SSW25}.
        \item[$\circ$] We then improve this result and show that $n = O(rd/\epsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to learn to error $\epsilon$ in the more challenging Bures distance. This is optimal due to the lower bound of~\cite{Yue23} and improves on the best known bound of $n = \widetilde{O}(rd/\epsilon^2)$ from prior work~\cite{HHJ+16,OW17a,FO24}.
        \item[$\circ$] We consider the scenario of full state tomography with limited entanglement, in which one is given $n$ copies of $\rho$ but only allowed to perform entangled measurements across $k$ of them at a time. We show that 
        \begin{equation*}
            n =O\left(\max \left(\frac{d^3}{\sqrt{k}\epsilon^2}, \frac{d^2}{\epsilon^2} \right) \right)
        \end{equation*}
        copies of $\rho$ suffice to learn $\rho$ to trace distance error $\epsilon$ in this scenario.
        This improves on the prior work of \cite{CLL24a} and matches their lower bound which holds for $k \leq 1/\epsilon^c$, where $c$ is a constant.
        \item[$\circ$] In the problem of shadow tomography, one is given $m$ observables $O_1, \ldots, O_m$, and the goal is to estimate each quantity $\tr(O_i \cdot \rho)$ up to $\epsilon$ error.
        If $\Vert O_i \Vert_{\infty} \leq 1$ for all $i$, we show that $O(\log(m)/\epsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient to solve this task in the ``high accuracy regime'' when $\epsilon = O(1/d)$. This improves a result of~\cite{CLL24b}, who showed this bound holds when $\epsilon = O(1/d^{12})$.
        More generally, we show that
        if $\tr(O_i^2) \leq F$ for all $i$, then
        \begin{equation*}
            n = O\Big(\log(m) \cdot \Big(\min\Big\{\frac{\sqrt{r F}}{\epsilon}, \frac{F^{2/3}}{\epsilon^{4/3}}\Big\} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\Big)\Big)
        \end{equation*}
        copies suffice to solve this task.
        This improves on a result of~\cite{GLM24}, who showed a bound of $n = O(\log(m) \cdot \sqrt{rF}/\epsilon^2)$, and disproves a conjecture of~\cite{CLL24b}.
        \item[$\circ$] Our final application is to the field of quantum metrology. In quantum metrology, one is provided copies of a mixed state $\rho_{\theta}$ parameterized by a vector $\theta \in \R^n$, and the goal is to estimate the parameter $\theta$. An algorithm is \emph{locally unbiased} at a parameter $\theta^*$ if, roughly, it is unbiased given $\rho_{\theta}$ when $\theta$ is in a small neighborhood around $\theta^*$. 
        The quantum Cramér–Rao bound states that the mean squared error matrix (MSEM) of any locally unbiased algorithm is lower bounded by the inverse of the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) matrix.
        We give a locally unbiased algorithm whose MSEM is \emph{upper bounded} by twice the inverse of the QFI matrix in the asymptotic limit of large $n$, which is optimal.

Recently, a new class of divergences - the f-divergences - has gained prominence in quantum information theory and received operational interpretations, while being long established in the classical setting. Furthermore, Frenkel showed that the Umegaki relative entropy is a special case of a quantum f-divergence for the function f(x) = x log x; building on this, Hirche et al. introduced a parameterized family of f-divergences that, in appropriate regimes, recovers the sandwiched and Petz relative entropies as regularizations. Taken together, these results reveal a tight link between the best-understood quantum divergences - the Umegaki, Petz, and sandwiched relative entropies - on a technical level and the general class of f-divergences, thereby strongly motivating a program that connects f-divergences to concrete quantum information tasks as already started by Cheng et al.

Designing next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of resources---energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality,  and others---yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel.
Its broad scope positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results: (1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in fact require an infinite implementation cost.

Yet the precise connection between nonlocality and randomness is more nuanced. We first show that there exist nontrivial Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by quantum correlations while certifying no randomness for any fixed input pair, rendering them ineffective for a large class of standard DI schemes. Moreover, we construct maximally nonlocal quantum correlations that remain deterministic for every fixed input pair, in the sense that for any chosen inputs they can be decomposed into strategies with fixed outputs. Conversely, we show when all input pairs are used for randomness generation, any amount of quantum nonlocality suffices to certify randomness, implying that no form of bound randomness exists in quantum nonlocality: every nonlocal behavior can be useful for DI randomness generation under an appropriately designed protocol.

Building on this, we introduce the average guessing probability over all inputs, in contrast to the hitherto considered fixed-input guessing probability, as a faithful and monotonic quantifier of nonlocality. Using this measure, we prove that, contrary to recent findings in PRL 134, 090201, the detection efficiency threshold for certifying randomness is never lower than that required for detecting nonlocality. Finally, we analytically compute the average guessing probability by a quantum adversary in the standard CHSH test and show how this leads to improved generation rates in state-of-the-art amplification protocols.

We prove that symmetric pseudorandom unitaries exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths for any discrete on-site group. We also provide extensions of our results to systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonian of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; removing this constraint remains an important open question.",,,,,,,Accepted,Thomas Schuster,30 January,09:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry,,Alexander Schmidhuber;Jonathan Z Lu;Stephen Jordan;Alexander Poremba;Noah Shutty;Yihui Quek,"MIT, Google;MIT;Google;MIT, Boston University;Google;MIT, EPFL","We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any degree-$\ell$ polynomial $\calP$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix $$\rho_\calP(H) = \calP^2(H)/\Tr[\calP^2(H)]$$ by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding $\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $\calP(x)$ to approximate $\exp(-\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature $\beta$; other choices of $\calP$ prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters.  

The decoding problem inherits structural properties of $H$; in particular, local Hamiltonians map to LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for a class of nearly commuting Pauli Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size. 

We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code, color code, and Haah's cubic code -- but also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task, thereby delineating the boundary of efficient classical simulation. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer code Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI provably prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical preprocessing. These results position HDQI as a versatile new algorithmic primitive, connecting quantum state preparation to classical decoding.",,,,,,,Accepted,Alexander Schmidhuber,27 January,14:00,30
QIP,2026,contributed,Optimising quantum data hiding,,Francesco Anna Mele;Ludovico Lami,Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa;Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa,"Quantum data hiding is the existence of pairs of bipartite quantum states that are (almost) perfectly distinguishable with global measurements, yet close to indistinguishable when only measurements implementable with local operations and classical communication are allowed. Remarkably, data hiding states can also be chosen to be separable, meaning that secrets can be hidden using no entanglement that are almost irretrievable without entanglement --- this is sometimes called `nonlocality without entanglement'. Essentially two families of data hiding states were known prior to this work: Werner states and random states. Hiding Werner states can be made either separable or globally perfectly orthogonal, but not both --- separability comes at the price of orthogonality being only approximate. Random states can hide many more bits, but they are typically entangled and again only approximately orthogonal. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of novel group-symmetric data hiding states that are simultaneously separable, perfectly orthogonal, and even invariant under partial transpose, thus exhibiting the phenomenon of nonlocality without entanglement to the utmost extent. Our analysis leverages novel applications of numerical analysis tools to study convex optimisation problems in quantum information theory, potentially offering technical insights that extend beyond this work.",,,,,,,Accepted,Francesco Anna Mele,30 January,11:30,30
QIP,2026,merged_contributed,Exponential Advantage from One More Replica in Estimating Nonlinear Properties of Quantum States,,Qi Ye;Dong-Ling Deng;Zhenhuan Liu,Tsinghua University;Tsinghua University;Tsinghua University,"Estimating nonlinear properties of quantum states, such as $\mathrm{tr}(\rho^{k} O)$, is fundamental in quantum information but challenging due to the intrinsic linearity of quantum mechanics.
    Typical approaches such as generalized swap test rely on joint access to $k$ replicas to convert nonlinear functions in $\rho$ into linear functions in $\rho^{\otimes k}$.
    In this work, we prove that this conversion is not only sufficient but also necessary: any protocol that can only perform $(k-1)$-replica joint measurements require exponentially many samples to estimate $\mathrm{tr}(\rho^{k}O)$ with nonzero $\tr(O)$, while $k$-replica joint measurements allow efficient estimation.
    This establishes, for the first time, an exponential separation between $(k-1)$- and $k$-replica protocols for general $k$, thereby defining a fine-grained hierarchy for replica quantum advantage and solving an open question in the literature.
    The workhorse of our proofs is a general indistinguishability principle showing that any ensemble assembled from Haar-random states is hard to distinguish from its average.
    We also leverage this principle in spectrum testing, proving that $k$-replica joint measurements are also necessary to efficiently distinguish two spectra that match on all moments up to degree $k-1$.
    Our work draws sharp boundaries on the power of joint measurements, shedding light on resource-complexity tradeoffs in quantum learning theory.",,,,,,,AcceptedAsMerge,,,,
