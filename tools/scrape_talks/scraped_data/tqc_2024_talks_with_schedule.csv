"TQC","2024","regular","Local random quantum circuits form approximate designs on arbitrary architectures","Shivan Mittal and Nicholas Hunter-Jones","Shivan Mittal; Nicholas Hunter-Jones","","","Wednesday","2024-09-11","09:30:00","30","","","","","BibTeX entry type: Talk","T24_309","Talk","","","We consider random quantum circuits (RQC) on arbitrary connected graphs whose edges determine the allowed 2-qudit interactions. Prior work has established that such n-qudit circuits with local dimension q on 1D, complete, and D-dimensional graphs form approximate unitary designs, that is, they generate unitaries from distributions close to the Haar measure on the unitary group U(q^n) after polynomially many gates. Here, we extend those results by proving that RQCs comprised of O(poly(n,k)) gates on a wide class of graphs form approximate unitary k-designs. We prove that RQCs on graphs with spanning trees of bounded degree and height form k-designs after O(|E|n rm poly(k)) gates, where |E| is the number of edges in the graph. Furthermore, we identify larger classes of graphs for which RQCs generate approximate designs in polynomial circuit size. For k łeq 4, we show that RQCs on graphs of certain maximum degrees form designs after O(|E|n) gates, providing explicit constants. We determine our circuit size bounds from the spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. To that end, we extend the finite-size (or Knabe) method for bounding gaps of frustration-free Hamiltonians on regular graphs to arbitrary connected graphs. We further introduce a new method based on the Detectability Lemma for determining the spectral gaps of Hamiltonians on arbitrary graphs. Our methods have wider applicability as the first method provides a succinct alternative proof of [Commun. Math. Phys. 291, 257 (2009)] and the second method proves that RQCs on any connected architecture form approximate designs in quasi-polynomial circuit size."

Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers up to exponentially stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. Furthermore, VCP removes most of the assumptions required in virtual state purification. Essentially, VCP is the first quantum error mitigation protocol that does not require specific knowledge about the noise models, the target quantum state, and the target problem while still offering rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction and quantum error mitigation beyond concatenation. We can remove all noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification, reaching beyond the standard bias-variance trade-off in quantum error mitigation. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution."

First, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be composed without incurring log factors through error reduction (emphexactness). Second, through careful accounting (emphthriftiness), the total query complexity is smaller if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inputs – a property that is much less obvious in quantum algorithms than in their classical counterparts. While these properties were previously seen through the model of span programs (alternatively, the dual adversary bound), a recent work by two of the authors (Belovs, Yolcu 2023) showed how to achieve these benefits without converting to span programs, by defining emphquantum Las Vegas query complexity. Independently, recent works, including by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022), have worked towards bringing thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of quantum emphtime complexity. In this work, we show how to achieve both exactness and thriftiness in the setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum subroutine composition results of Jeffery 2022 so that, in particular, no error reduction is needed. We give a time complexity version of the well-known result in quantum query complexity, Q(fcirc g)=ØO(Q(f)cdot Q(g)), without log factors. We achieve this by employing a novel approach to the design of quantum algorithms based on what we call emphtransducers, and which we think is of large independent interest. While a span program is a completely different computational model, a transducer is a direct generalisation of a quantum algorithm, which allows for much greater transparency and control. Transducers naturally characterize general state conversion, rather than only decision problems; provide a very simple treatment of other quantum primitives such as quantum walks; and lend themselves well to time complexity analysis."

Asymptotically optimal QLSSs have query complexity O(κlog(1/ε)), where κ is the condition number of A, and ε is the approximation error. However, runtime guarantees for existing optimal and near-optimal QLSSs do not have favorable constant factors, in part because they rely on complex or difficult-to-analyze techniques like variable-time amplitude amplification and adiabatic path-following. Here, we give a conceptually simple, near-optimal QLSS that does not use these techniques. If the solution norm ∥x∥∥A∥/∥b∥ is known exactly, our QLSS requires only a single application of kernel reflection (an extension of eigenstate filtering), and has query complexity (1 + O(ε))κ ln(2√2/ε). If the norm is not known, it can be estimated up to a constant factor using O(log log(κ)) applications of kernel projection (a slight generalization of eigenstate filtering), yielding a QLSS with near-optimal total complexity O(κ log log(κ) log log log(κ) + κ log(1/ε)). Preliminary constant-factor analysis suggests that for practical values of κ, ε our QLSS provides rigorous guarantees that are at least an order of magnitude better than previous guarantees."

For dichotomies (pairs of states), this is closely connected to (classical or quantum) Rényi divergences (RD) and the data-processing inequality: If a RD remains unchanged when a channel is applied to the dichotomy, then there is a recovery channel mapping the image back to the initial dichotomy. Here, we prove for classical dichotomies that equality of the RDs alone is already sufficient for the existence of a channel in any of the two directions and discuss some applications. In the quantum case, all families of quantum RDs are seen to be insufficient because they cannot detect anti-unitary transformations. Thus, including anti-unitaries, we pose the problem of finding a sufficient family. It is shown that the Petz and maximal quantum RD are still insufficient in this more general sense and we provide evidence for sufficiency of the minimal quantum RD. As a side result of our techniques, we obtain an infinite list of inequalities fulfilled by the classical, the Petz quantum, and the maximal quantum RDs. These inequalities are not true for the minimal quantum RDs. Our results further imply that any sufficient set of conditions for state transitions in the resource theory of athermality must be able to detect time-reversal."

In particular, let C be a family of non-uniform quantum circuits of polynomial size and suppose that there exists an algorithm that, given copies of |ψ⟩, distinguishes whether |ψ⟩ is produced by C or is Haar random, promised one of these is the case. For arbitrary fixed constant c, we show that if the algorithm uses at most O(2^n^c) time and 2^n^0.99 samples then stateBQE⊄stateC. Here stateBQE:=stateBQTIME[2^O(n)] and stateC are state synthesis complexity classes as introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which capture problems with classical inputs but quantum output. Note that efficient tomography implies a similarly efficient distinguishing algorithm against Haar random states, even for nearly exponential-time algorithms. Because every state produced by a polynomial-size circuit can be learned with 2O(n) samples and time, or O(n^ω(1)) samples and 2^O(n^ω(1)) time, we show that even slightly non-trivial quantum state tomography algorithms would lead to new statements about quantum state synthesis. Finally, a slight modification of our proof shows that distinguishing algorithms for quantum states can imply circuit lower bounds for decision problems as well. This help sheds light on why time-efficient tomography algorithms for non-uniform quantum circuit classes has only had limited and partial progress. Our work parallels results by Arunachalam et al. (FOCS 2021) that revealed a similar connection between quantum learning of Boolean functions and circuit lower bounds for classical circuit classes, but modified for the purposes of state tomography and state synthesis."

In this work, we prove that an efficiently implementable dissipative evolution recently introduced by Chen et al. thermalizes into its equilibrium Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or ``thermofield double"" states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of Lindbladians for inverse temperatures logarithmic in the system's size is polynomially equivalent to standard quantum computation. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian and the analysis of the stability of its gap. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature of the Laplace transform of the energy observable at fixed runtime, and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that the family of Lindbladians of Chen et al. efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and have the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems."

In this work, we present an error correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit-level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes bivariate bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits."

However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of Renyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-Renyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or f-weighted Rényi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well."

Despite their versatility, these computational models are known to be less powerful than Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) circuits, which serve as a natural model for neural networks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and computational capabilities. We prove that PTF circuits with a constant number of layers, when biased (having the activation region of their gates limited), fail to solve certain computational (relational) problems that quantum circuits of constant depth can solve. Furthermore, we prove such a separation for a family of problems, one for each prime qudit dimension. We prove all of these separations via correlation bounds for average-case hardness. We also establish a tight lower bound on the size of biased PTF circuits that can solve a specific relational problem *exactly*. This allows us to significantly reduce the estimated resource requirements for potential demonstrations of quantum advantage. The main challenges in this area of research arise in establishing the classical lower bounds, and in designing non-local games with quantum-classical gaps in the winning strategy in order to go beyond qubits to higher dimensions. To address the former, we have formulated novel switching lemmas specifically designed for multi-output biased PTF circuits, and have developed a way to assess the difficulty of deriving exact solutions. Our contribution towards the latter is grounded in a novel assortment of non-local games, characterized by an exponential difference between their classical and quantum success probabilities. Finally, our technical developments could be of more general and independent interest."

In this paper, we construct a new family of [[N,K,D]] codes, referred to as hierarchical codes, that encode a number of logical qubits K = Omega(N/łog(N)^2). The N-th element of this code family is obtained by concatenating a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with a surface code; nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions are sufficient to implement the corresponding syndrome-extraction circuit and achieve a threshold. Below threshold the logical failure rate vanishes superpolynomially as a function of the distance D(N).

These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. The simplest non-trivial example is a fault-tolerant circuit for the double-semion phase, defined on the same set of qubits as the stabilizer toric code, with 12 controlled-S gates in addition to the 8 controlled-X gates and 2 single-qubit measurements of the toric code per spacetime unit cell. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code.

By using simple commutation rules, a quantum circuit can be transpiled into a sequence of solely non-Clifford multi-qubit gates. Prior work on fault-tolerant compilation avoids optimal scheduling of such gates since they reduce the parallelizability of the circuit. We observe that the reduced parallelization potential is outweighed by the significant reduction in the number of gates. We therefore devise a method for scheduling multi-qubit lattice surgery using an earliest-available-first policy, solving the associated forest packing problem using a representation of the multi-qubit gates as Steiner trees. Our extensive testing on random and application-inspired circuits demonstrates the method's scalability and performance. We show that the transpilation significantly reduces the circuit length on the set of circuits tested, and that the resulting circuit of multi-qubit gates has a further reduction in the expected circuit execution time compared to serial execution."

These algorithms capitalize on the universality of quantum signal transformation to decouple two interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Our approach combines provably optimal classical estimation with nearly optimal quantum circuit design, achieving unparalleled accuracy of 10−4 radians in standard deviation for estimating extremely small angles in superconducting qubit experiments with low-depth (&lt; 10) circuits. This accuracy surpasses existing alternatives by two orders of magnitude and is adaptable to ion trap gates.

Our result can be seen as an aspect of a connection between homology and supersymmetric quantum mechanics [Wit82].

Building on a recently introduced framework of interactive proof systems for classical machine learning by Goldwasser et al.

We exhibit learning problems that a classical learner cannot efficiently solve on their own, but that they can efficiently and reliably solve when interacting with an untrusted quantum prover. Concretely, we consider the problems of agnostic learning parities and Fourier-sparse functions with respect to distributions with uniform input marginal. We propose a new quantum data access model that we call ""mixture-of-superpositions"" quantum examples, based on which we give efficient quantum learning algorithms for these tasks. Moreover, we prove that agnostic quantum parity and Fourier-sparse learning can be efficiently verified by a classical verifier with only random example or statistical query access. Finally, we showcase two general scenarios in learning and verification in which quantum mixture-of-superpositions examples do not lead to sample complexity improvements over classical data.

We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states, marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank – a pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4 under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings.

We analyze the error accumulated in observables in this setting and show that, due to stochastic error cancellation, with high probability the error scales as the square root of the number of qubits instead of linearly. We explore the concentration phenomenon of this error as well as its implications for local observables in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that stochastic error cancellation also manifests in the fidelity between the target state at the end of time-evolution and the actual state we obtain in the presence of noise.

First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality O(log⋆n) in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the Θ(log⋆n) complexity class by using non-signaling arguments. Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for rooted trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality o(loglogn) in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality O(log⋆n) in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.

We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources, where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity.

Here, we study QSAT with each constraint acting on a k-dimensional and l-dimensional qudit pair, denoted (k,l)-QSAT. Our first main result shows that, surprisingly, QSAT on qubits can remain QMA_1-hard, in that (2,5)-QSAT is QMA_1-complete. (QMA_1 is a quantum analogue of MA with perfect completeness.) In contrast, (2,2)-QSAT (i.e. Quantum 2-SAT on qubits) is well-known to be poly-time solvable [Bravyi, 2006]. Our second main result proves that (3,d)-QSAT on the 1D line with d = O(1) is also QMA_1-hard. Finally, we initiate the study of (2,d)-QSAT on the 1D line by giving a frustration-free 1D Hamiltonian with a unique, entangled ground state. As implied by our title, our first result uses a direct embedding: We combine a novel clock construction with the 2D circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction of [Gosset and Nagaj, 2013]. Of note is a new simplified and analytic proof for the latter (as opposed to a partially numeric proof in [GN13]). This exploits Unitary Labelled Graphs [Bausch, Cubitt, Ozols, 2017] together with a new """"Nullspace Connection Lemma"""", allowing us to break low energy analyses into small patches of projectors, and to improve the soundness analysis of [GN13] from Omega(1/T^6) to Omega(1/T^2), for T the number of gates. Our second result goes via black-box reduction: Given an arbitrary 1D Hamiltonian H on d'-dimensional qudits, we show how to embed it into an effective 1D (3,d)-QSAT instance, for d = O(1). Our approach may be viewed as a weaker notion of """"simulation"""" (à la [Bravyi, Hastings 2017], [Cubitt, Montanaro, Piddock 2018]). As far as we are aware, this gives the first """"black-box simulation""""-based QMA_1-hardness result."

Our research establishes a path to achieving the exact inverse of unknown channels with certain conditions, accompanied by a no-go theorem that underscores the intrinsic limitations imposed by quantum mechanics on such tasks. Notably, we demonstrate that an n-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse a depolarizing channel with one unknown noise parameter out of n+1 potential candidates, and a 1-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse an arbitrary pair of quantum channels. We further explore the approximate inverse of an unknown channel within a given channel set. For any unknown depolarizing channels within a specified noise region, we unveil a worst-case error decay of O(n^−1) of reversing the channel via virtual combs. Moreover, we show that virtual combs with constant slots can be applied to universally reverse unitary operations and investigate the trade-off between the slot number and the sampling overhead."

A major obstacle in realizing FTQC with conventional protocols, such as those based on the surface code and the concatenated Steane code, has been the space overhead, i.e., the required number of physical qubits per logical qubit. Protocols based on high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes gather considerable attention as a way to reduce the space overhead, but problematically, the existing fault-tolerant protocols for such quantum LDPC codes sacrifice the other factors. Here we construct a new fault-tolerant protocol to meet these requirements simultaneously based on more recent progress on the techniques for concatenated codes rather than quantum LDPC codes, achieving a constant space overhead, a high threshold, and flexibility in modular architecture designs. In particular, under a physical error rate of 0.1%, our protocol reduces the space overhead to achieve the logical CNOT error rates 10^-10 and 10^-24 by more than 90% and 97%, respectively, compared to the protocol for the surface code. Furthermore, our protocol achieves the threshold of 2.4% under a conventional circuit-level error model, substantially outperforming that of the surface code. The use of concatenated codes also naturally introduces abstraction layers essential for the modularity of FTQC architectures. These results indicate that the code-concatenation approach opens a way to significantly save qubits in realizing FTQC while fulfilling the other essential requirements for the practical protocol design."

Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs faces several technical challenges, and consequently the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored. In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels induced by circuits, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We also use this approach to reimagine the clique and independent set problems for classical graphs, by taking the inputs to be circuits of deterministic or noisy channels which implicitly determine confusability graphs. We show that, by varying the collection of channels in the language, these give rise to complete problems for the classes NP, MA, QMA, and QMA(2). In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantisation is QMA(2), rather than QMA, which is commonly assumed. To prove the results in the quantum case, we make use of methods inspired by self-testing. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we include a new proof of the reduction of QMA(k) to QMA(2) via cliques for quantum graphs.

Here, we describe a protocol for using a fault-tolerant quantum computer to calculate stopping power from a first-quantized representation of the electrons and projectile. Our approach builds upon the electronic structure block encodings of Su et al.

Ultimately, we report logical qubit requirements and leading-order Toffoli costs for computing the stopping power of various projectile/target combinations relevant to interpreting and designing inertial fusion experiments.

Fraigniaud et al. showed that, when the network size is small, there exists an exponential separation in proof size between distributed classical and quantum verification protocols, for the equality problem, where the verifiers check if all the data owned by a subset of them are identical. In this paper, we further investigate and characterize the power of the dQMA protocols for various decision problems. First, we give a more efficient dQMA protocol for the equality problem with a simpler analysis. This is done by adding a symmetrization step on each node and exploiting properties of the permutation test, which is a generalization of the SWAP test. We also show a quantum advantage for the equality problem on path networks still persists even when the network size is large, by considering ``relay points'' between extreme nodes.

Two further regimes exist within each of these in which the resource state used for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state, or free to be optimised. Recently, works resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for qudits.

The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-round proof systems, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However, the construction in Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen uses six provers, and there is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via simulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZK-MIP* protocols for all of MIP*? In this paper, we show that every language in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK-MIP* protocol, answering the question in the affirmative. For the proof, we use a new method based on a key consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem, which is that every MIP* protocol can be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games.

To show quantum soundness of this classical construction, we develop a toolkit for analyzing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games, which we expect to be useful more broadly.

Combined with good code parameters, the resulting constant-time overhead of QEC and robustness to (possibly time-correlated) adversarial noise make quantum Tanner codes alluring from the perspective of quantum fault-tolerant protocols."

In our second approach, termed the ""operator space approach"", we express the entropic measures as norms and utilize their properties for establishing the bounds. These norms draw inspiration from interpolation space norms. We not only demonstrate the norm properties solely relying on matrix analysis tools but also extend their applicability to a context that holds relevance in resource theories.

Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is in fact local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown Hamiltonian H is k-local or epsilon-far from all k-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along H. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require at least order 2^n many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of order 2^n/epsilon, and even coherent testers need at least order 2^(n/2) many queries and order 2^(n/2)/epsilon total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning."

However, the many directions of quantum learning theory have so far evolved separately. We propose a general mathematical formalism for describing quantum learning by training on classical-quantum data and then testing how well the learned hypothesis generalizes to new data. In this framework, we prove bounds on the expected generalization error of a quantum learner in terms of classical and quantum mutual information quantities measuring how strongly the learner's hypothesis depends on the specific data seen during training. To achieve this, we use tools from quantum optimal transport and quantum concentration inequalities to establish non-commutative versions of decoupling lemmas that underlie recent information-theoretic generalization bounds for classical machine learning. Our framework encompasses and gives intuitively accessible generalization bounds for a variety of quantum learning scenarios such as quantum state discrimination, PAC learning quantum states, quantum parameter estimation, and quantumly PAC learning classical functions. Thereby, our work lays a foundation for a unifying quantum information-theoretic perspective on quantum learning."

We give a construction of two-tier one-shot signatures from the LWE assumption. As a complementary result, we also construct digital signatures with quantum revocation from group actions, where the quantum signing key is simply ``returned'' and then verified as part of revocation. Second, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signatures from OWFs. In this primitive, the signer can produce quantum signatures which can later be revoked.

Although secret sharing typically does not require any computational hardness assumptions, its security does require that an adversary cannot collect an authorized set of shares. Over long periods of time where an adversary can benefit from multiple data breaches, this may become an unrealistic assumption. We initiate the systematic study of secret sharing with certified deletion in order to achieve security even against an adversary that eventually collects an authorized set of shares. In secret sharing with certified deletion, a (classical) secret s is split into quantum shares that can be destroyed in a manner verifiable by the dealer. We put forth two natural definitions of security. No-signaling security roughly requires that if multiple non-communicating adversaries delete sufficiently many shares, then their combined view contains negligible information about s, even if the total set of corrupted parties forms an authorized set. Adaptive security requires privacy of s against an adversary that can continuously and adaptively corrupt new shares and delete previously-corrupted shares, as long as the total set of corrupted shares minus deleted shares remains unauthorized. Next, we show that these security definitions are achievable: we show how to construct (i) a secret sharing scheme with no-signaling certified deletion for any monotone access structure, and (ii) a threshold secret sharing scheme with adaptive certified deletion. Our first construction uses Bartusek and Khurana's (CRYPTO 2023) 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme with certified deletion as a building block, while our second construction is built from scratch and requires several new technical ideas. For example, we significantly generalize the ``XOR extractor'' of Agarwal, Bartusek, Khurana, and Kumar (EUROCRYPT 2023) in order to obtain better seedless extraction from certain quantum sources of entropy, and show how polynomial interpolation can double as a high-rate randomness extractor in our context of threshold sharing with certified deletion."

It has recently been pointed out by Chen, Liu and Zhandry[CLZ22] that this reduction can be made more powerful by replacing the LWE problem with a quantum equivalent, where the errors are given in quantum superposition. In parallel, Regev's reduction has recently been adapted in the context of code-based cryptography by Debris, Remaud and Tillich[DRT23], who showed a reduction between the Short Codeword Problem and the Decoding Problem (the DRT reduction). This motivates the study of the Quantum Decoding Problem (QDP), which is the Decoding Problem but with errors in quantum superposition and see how it behaves in the DRT reduction. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and to lay a firm foundation for QDP. We first show QD Pis likely to be easier than classical decoding, by proving that it can be solved in quantum polynomial time in a large regime of noise whereas no non-exponential quantum algorithm is known for the classical decoding problem. Then, we show that QDP can even be solved (albeit not necessarily efficiently) beyond the information theoretic Shannon limit for classical decoding. We give precisely the largest noise level where we can solve QDP giving in a sense the information theoretic limit for this new problem. Finally, we study how QDP can be used in the DRT reduction. First, we show that our algorithms can be properly used in the DRT reduction showing that our quantum algorithms for QDP beyond Shannon capacity can be used to find minimal weight codewords in a random code. On the negative side, we show that the DRT reduction cannot be, in all generality, a reduction between finding small codewords and QDP by exhibiting quantum algorithms for QDP where this reduction entirely fails. Our proof techniques include the use of specific quantum measurements, such as q-ary unambiguous state discrimination and pretty good measurements as well as strong concentration bounds on weight distribution of random shifted dual codes, which we relate using quantum Fourier analysis."

It is interesting to ask this question for different choices of constraints on the structures of the original channel and state, and requiring that these are also satisfied by the new channel and state. We affirmatively answer the above question, under fairly general assumptions on these structures, through a compactness argument. Ad- ditionally, for channels and states satisfying certain specific structures, we find explicit upper bounds on the distances between the pairs of channels (and states) in question. When these distances decay quickly (in a particular, desirable manner) as ε → 0, we say that the original approximate fixed point equation is rapidly fixable. We establish rapid fixability, not only for general quantum channels, but also when the original and new channels are both required to be unitary, mixed unitary or unital. In contrast, for the case of bipartite quantum systems with channels acting trivially on one subsys- tem, we prove that approximate fixed point equations are not rapidly fixable. In this case, the distance to the closest channel (and state) which satisfy an exact fixed point equation can depend on the dimension of the quantum system in an undesirable way. We apply our results on approximate fixed point equations to the question of robust- ness of quantum Markov chains (QMC) and establish the following: For any tripartite quantum state, there exists a dimension-dependent upper bound on its distance to the set of QMCs, which decays to zero as the conditional mutual information of the state vanishes."

Our understanding of this phenomenon underwent a transformative shift with the recent introduction of a Lie algebraic theory capable of explaining most sources of barren plateaus. However, this theory requires either initial states or observables that lie in the circuit's Lie algebra. Focusing on parametrized matchgate circuits, in this work we are able to go beyond this assumption and provide an exact formula for the loss function variance that is valid for arbitrary input states and measurements. Our results reveal that new phenomena emerge when the Lie algebra constraint is relaxed. For instance, we find that the variance does not necessarily vanish inversely with the Lie algebra's dimension. Instead, this measure of expressiveness is replaced by a generalized expressiveness quantity: the dimension of the Lie group modules. By characterizing the operators in these modules as products of Majorana operators, we can introduce a precise notion of generalized globality and show that measuring generalized-global operators leads to barren plateaus. Our work also provides operational meaning to the generalized entanglement as we connect it with known fermionic entanglement measures, and show that it satisfies a monogamy relation. Finally, while parameterized matchgate circuits are not efficiently simulable in general, our results suggest that the structure allowing for trainability may also lead to classical simulability."

In the classical case, there are examples of concept classes with VC dimension d that have sample complexity Ω(d/ϵ log(1/ϵ)) for proper learning with error ϵ, while the complexity for improper learning is O(d/ϵ). One such example arises from the Coupon Collector problem. Motivated by the efficiency of proper versus improper learning with quantum samples, Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC 2020) studied an analogue, the Quantum Coupon Collector problem. Curiously, they discovered that for learning size k subsets of [n] the problem has sample complexity Θ(k log mink,n−k+1), in contrast with the complexity of Θ(k log k) for Coupon Collector. This effectively negates the possibility of a separation between the two modes of learning via the quantum problem, and Arunachalam et al. posed the possibility of such a separation as an open question. In this work, we first present an algorithm for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem with sample complexity that matches the sharper lower bound of (1−o_k(1))k ln mink,n−k+1 shown recently by Bab Hadiashar, Nayak, and Sinha (IEEE TIT 2024), for the entire range of the parameter k.

This question is almost as old as the Internet and significant effort has been spent on designing mechanisms to prevent and detect such attacks. Once quantum computers arrive, will the situation remain the same or can we hope to live in a better world? We first consider ubiquitous side-channel attacks, which aim to leak side information on secret system components, studied in the leakage-resilient cryptography literature. Classical leakage-resilient cryptography must necessarily impose restrictions on the type of leakage one aims to protect against. As a notable example, the most well-studied leakage model is that of bounded leakage, where it is assumed that an adversary learns at most L bits of leakage on secret components, for some leakage bound L. Although this leakage bound is necessary, many real-world side-channel attacks cannot be captured by bounded leakage. In this work, we design cryptographic schemes that provide guarantees against arbitrary side channel attacks: - Using techniques from unclonable quantum cryptography, we design several basic leakage- resilient primitives, such as public- and private-key encryption, (weak) pseudorandom functions, digital signatures and quantum money schemes which remain secure under (polynomially) unbounded classical leakage. In particular, this leakage can be much longer than the (quantum) secret being leaked upon. In our view, leakage is the result of observations of quantities such as power consumption and hence is most naturally viewed as classical information. Notably, the leakage-resilience of our schemes holds even in the stronger “LOCC leakage” model where the adversary can obtain adaptive leakage for unbounded number of rounds. - What if the adversary simply breaks into our system to steal our secret keys, rather than mounting only a side-channel attack?What if the adversary can even tamper with the data arbitrarily, for example to cover its tracks? We initiate the study of intrusion detection in the quantum setting, where one would like to detect if security has been compromised even in the face of an arbitrary intruder attack which can leak and tamper with classical as well as quantum data. We design cryptographic schemes supporting intrusion-detection for a host of primitives such as public- and private-key encryption, digital signature, functional encryption, program obfuscation and software protection. Our schemes are based on techniques from cryptography with secure key leasing and certified deletion."

In this study, we present three main improvements to existing quantum algorithms based on the Carleman linearisation technique. First, by using a high-precision technique for the solution of the linearised differential equations, we achieve logarithmic dependence of the complexity on the error and near-linear dependence on time. Second, we demonstrate that a rescaling technique can considerably reduce the cost, which would otherwise be exponential in the Carleman order for a system of ODEs, preventing a quantum speedup for PDEs. Third, we provide improved, tighter bounds on the error of Carleman linearisation. We apply our results to a class of discretised reaction-diffusion equations using higher-order finite differences for spatial resolution. We show that providing a stability criterion independent of the discretisation can conflict with the use of the rescaling due to the difference between the max-norm and 2-norm. An efficient solution may still be provided if the number of discretisation points is limited, as is possible when using higher-order discretisations."

Here we investigate a new learning resource which could be available to quantum computers in the future – measurements on the unknown state accompanied by its complex conjugate ρ⊗ρ*. For a certain shadow tomography task, we surprisingly find that measurements on only copies of ρ⊗ρ* can be exponentially more powerful than measurements on ρ⊗K, even for large K. This expands the class of exponential advantages using only a constant overhead quantum memory, or minimal quantum memory, and we provide a number of examples where the state ρ* is naturally available in both computational and physical applications. In addition, we precisely quantify the power of classical shadows on single copies under a generalized Clifford ensemble and give a class of quantities that can be efficiently learned. The learning task we study in both the single copy and quantum memory is physically natural and corresponds to real-space observables with a limit of bosonic modes, where it achieves an exponential improvement in detecting certain signals under a noisy background. In addition to quantifying a fundamentally new and powerful resource in quantum learning, we believe the advantage may find applications in improving quantum simulation, learning from quantum sensors, and uncovering new physical phenomena."

Problems exhibiting this advantage include search and sampling tasks related to the parity function, and it is natural to ask whether QNC0 can be used to help compute parity itself. Namely, we study AC0◦QNC0—a hybrid circuit model where AC0 operates on measurement outcomes of a QNC0 circuit—and we ask whether Par ∈ AC0◦QNC0. We believe the answer is negative. In fact, we conjecture AC0◦QNC0 cannot even achieve Ω(1) correlation with parity. As evidence for this conjecture, we prove the following: • When the QNC0 circuit is ancilla-free, we show this model can achieve only negligible correlation with parity, even when AC0 is replaced with any function having LMN-like decay in its Fourier spectrum. • For the general (non-ancilla-free) case, we show via a connection to nonlocal games that the conjecture holds for any class of postprocessing functions that has approximate degree o(n) and is closed under restrictions. Moreover, this is true even when the QNC0 circuit is given arbitrary quantum advice. By known results, this conﬁrms the conjecture for linear-size AC0 circuits. • Another approach to proving the conjecture is to show a switching lemma for AC0◦QNC0. Towards this goal, we study the effect of quantum preprocessing on the decision tree complexity of Boolean functions. We ﬁnd that from the point of view of a decision tree, nonlocal channels are no better than randomness: a Boolean function f precomposed with an n-party nonlocal channel is together equal to a randomized decision tree with depth no greater than DTdepth[f]. Taken together, our results suggest that while QNC0 is surprisingly powerful for search and sampling, that power is “locked away” in the global correlations of its output, inaccessible to simple classical computation for solving decision problems."

On the other hand, we prove that, in general, it is impossible for any quantum algorithm to achieve quadratic speed-up over the number of classical samples needed to estimate the mean μ, where the samples come from different random variables with mean close to μ. Technically, our quantum algorithms reduce bounded and sub-Gaussian random variables to the Bernoulli case, and use an uncomputation trick to overcome the challenge that direct amplitude estimation does not work with non-identical query access. Our quantum query lower bounds are established by simulating non-identical oracles by parallel oracles, and also by an adversarial method with non-identical oracles. Both results pave the way for proving quantum query lower bounds with non-identical oracles in general, which may be of independent interest."

Unlike their guided counterparts, these problems do not have a guiding state provided as a part of the input, but merely come with the promise that one exists. We consider in particular two classes of guiding states: those that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum circuit; and those belonging to a class of quantum states we call classically evaluatable, for which it is possible to efficiently compute expectation values of local observables classically. We show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for both classes of guiding states are 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠-complete in the inverse-polynomial precision setting, but lie within 𝖭𝖯 (or 𝖭𝗊𝖯) in the constant precision regime when the guiding state is classically evaluatable. Our completeness results show that, from a complexity-theoretic perspective, classical Ansätze selected by classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum Ansätze prepared by quantum heuristics, as long as one has access to quantum phase estimation. In relation to the quantum PCP conjecture, we (i) define a complexity class capturing quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proof systems and show that it is contained in BQP^NP[1] for constant proof queries; (ii) give a no-go result on 'dequantizing' the known quantum reduction which maps a 𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖯-verification circuit to a local Hamiltonian with constant promise gap; (iii) give several no-go results for the existence of quantum gap amplification procedures that preserve certain ground state properties; and (iv) propose two conjectures that can be viewed as stronger versions of the NLTS theorem.

It is known though that the adversary method, in its general negative-weighted version, is tight for bounded-error quantum algorithms, whereas the polynomial method is not. By the tightness of the former, for any polynomial lower bound, there ought to exist a corresponding adversary lower bound. However, direct reduction was not known. In this paper, we give a simple and direct reduction from the polynomial method (in the form of a dual polynomial) to the adversary method. This shows that any lower bound in the form of a dual polynomial is actually an adversary lower bound of a specific form."

As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity.

Understandings in rotor Clifford group allow us to establish connections between homological rotor error-correcting codes and oscillator quantum codes, including Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes and rotation-symmetric bosonic codes. Inspired by homological rotor codes, we provide a systematic construction of multi-mode rotation-symmetric bosonic codes by analoging Fock states to rotor states with non-negative angular momentum. This new family of multi-mode bosonic codes protect against dephasing and changes in occupation numbers, which we call homological number-phase codes. Their encoding and decoding circuits are readily derived from the corresponding rotor Clifford operations. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post-selection.
