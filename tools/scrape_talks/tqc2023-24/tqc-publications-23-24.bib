abstract = {We consider random quantum circuits (RQC) on arbitrary connected graphs whose edges determine the allowed 2-qudit interactions. Prior work has established that such $n$-qudit circuits with local dimension $q$ on 1D, complete, and $D$-dimensional graphs form approximate unitary designs, that is, they generate unitaries from distributions close to the Haar measure on the unitary group $U(q^n)$ after polynomially many gates. Here, we extend those results by proving that RQCs comprised of $O(poly(n,k))$ gates on a wide class of graphs form approximate unitary $k$-designs. We prove that RQCs on graphs with spanning trees of bounded degree and height form $k$-designs after $O(|E|n rm poly(k))$ gates, where $|E|$ is the number of edges in the graph. Furthermore, we identify larger classes of graphs for which RQCs generate approximate designs in polynomial circuit size. For $k łeq 4$, we show that RQCs on graphs of certain maximum degrees form designs after $O(|E|n)$ gates, providing explicit constants. We determine our circuit size bounds from the spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. To that end, we extend the finite-size (or Knabe) method for bounding gaps of frustration-free Hamiltonians on regular graphs to arbitrary connected graphs. We further introduce a new method based on the Detectability Lemma for determining the spectral gaps of Hamiltonians on arbitrary graphs. Our methods have wider applicability as the first method provides a succinct alternative proof of [Commun. Math. Phys. 291, 257 (2009)] and the second method proves that RQCs on any connected architecture form approximate designs in quasi-polynomial circuit size.},

abstract = {We show that marginals of blocks of t systems of any finitely correlated translation invariant state on a chain can be learned, in trace distance, with O(t2) copies – with an explicit dependence on local dimension, memory dimension and spectral properties of a certain map constructed from the state – and computational complexity polynomial in t. The algorithm requires only the estimation of a marginal of a controlled size, in the worst case bounded by the minimum bond dimension, from which it reconstructs a translation invariant matrix product operator. In the analysis, a central role is played by the theory of operator systems. A refined error bound can be proven for C∗-finitely correlated states, which have an operational interpretation in terms of sequential quantum channels applied to the memory system. We can also obtain an analogous error bound for a class of matrix product density operators reconstructible by local marginals. In this case, a linear number of marginals must be estimated, obtaining a sample complexity of Õ(t3). The learning algorithm also works for states that are only close to a finitely correlated state, with the potential of providing competitive algorithms for other interesting families of states.},

abstract = {Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers up to exponentially stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. Furthermore, VCP removes most of the assumptions required in virtual state purification. Essentially, VCP is the first quantum error mitigation protocol that does not require specific knowledge about the noise models, the target quantum state, and the target problem while still offering rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction and quantum error mitigation beyond concatenation. We can remove all noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification, reaching beyond the standard bias-variance trade-off in quantum error mitigation. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution.},

abstract = {Entanglement detection is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum information science, and as quantum devices advance, researchers work to develop effective and efficient detection methods. 
Over time, researchers have recognized the inherent limitations in entanglement detection. 
Notably, a trade-off between detection power and the number of observables has been established for entanglement criteria. 
Yet, our understanding of the complexities of practical entanglement detection protocols (EDPs) and their relationship with entanglement criteria (EC) remains limited. 
In this study, we bridge this knowledge gap by providing a precise definition and introducing postulates for EDP. 
Building on this definition, we demonstrate an exponential separation between the sample complexity of EDP and the number of observables for EC through a typical bipartite entanglement detection task. 
Furthermore, we discover that the optimal EDP with the lowest sample complexity does not necessarily correspond to the optimal EC with the fewest observables. 
Our findings can be extended to multipartite scenarios and can be used to prove the exponential speedups achieved through quantum memory. By highlighting the significance and independence of EDP design, our work holds substantial practical implications for entanglement detection experiments.},

author = {Aleksandrs Belovs and Stacey Jeffery and Duyal Yolcu},
year  = {2024},
date = {2024-01-01},
abstract = {Quantum query complexity has several nice properties with respect to composition. First, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be composed without incurring log factors through error reduction (emphexactness). Second, through careful accounting (emphthriftiness), the total query complexity is smaller if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inputs – a property that is much less obvious in quantum algorithms than in their classical counterparts. While these properties were previously seen through the model of span programs (alternatively, the dual adversary bound), a recent work by two of the authors (Belovs, Yolcu 2023) showed how to achieve these benefits without converting to span programs, by defining emphquantum Las Vegas query complexity. Independently, recent works, including by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022), have worked towards bringing thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of quantum emphtime complexity. In this work, we show how to achieve both exactness and thriftiness in the setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum subroutine composition results of Jeffery 2022 so that, in particular, no error reduction is needed. We give a time complexity version of the well-known result in quantum query complexity, $Q(fcirc g)=ØO(Q(f)cdot Q(g))$, without log factors. We achieve this by employing a novel approach to the design of quantum algorithms based on what we call emphtransducers, and which we think is of large independent interest. While a span program is a completely different computational model, a transducer is a direct generalisation of a quantum algorithm, which allows for much greater transparency and control. Transducers naturally characterize general state conversion, rather than only decision problems; provide a very simple treatment of other quantum primitives such as quantum walks; and lend themselves well to time complexity analysis.},

abstract = {Erasure qubits are a promising path to achieving error rates below the error-correcting threshold with current superconducting hardware. In this study, we investigate in detail the effect of erasure on dual-rail qubits, a major candidate for erasure qubits based on transmons. We find that reducing the number of erasure detections per round can reduce the physical requirement on the transmons composing the dual-rails. We further show that by changing the type of 2-Qubit gate, we can bias the erasure noise and further improve the erasure threshold using the XZZX code. Since dual-rails can detect decay and leakage without disturbing the logical subspace, we further show how they can mitigate the effect of leakage better than standard transmons, since the effect of false-positive and false-negative detection can be controlled by changing the number of detections per round.},

abstract = {Given a linear system of equations Ax = b, quantum linear system solvers (QLSSs) approximately prepare a quantum state |x⟩ for which the amplitudes are proportional to the solution vector x. Asymptotically optimal QLSSs have query complexity O(κlog(1/ε)), where κ is the condition number of A, and ε is the approximation error. However, runtime guarantees for existing optimal and near-optimal QLSSs do not have favorable constant factors, in part because they rely on complex or difficult-to-analyze techniques like variable-time amplitude amplification and adiabatic path-following. Here, we give a conceptually simple, near-optimal QLSS that does not use these techniques. If the solution norm ∥x∥∥A∥/∥b∥ is known exactly, our QLSS requires only a single application of kernel reflection (an extension of eigenstate filtering), and has query complexity (1 + O(ε))κ ln(2√2/ε). If the norm is not known, it can be estimated up to a constant factor using O(log log(κ)) applications of kernel projection (a slight generalization of eigenstate filtering), yielding a QLSS with near-optimal total complexity O(κ log log(κ) log log log(κ) + κ log(1/ε)). Preliminary constant-factor analysis suggests that for practical values of κ, ε our QLSS provides rigorous guarantees that are at least an order of magnitude better than previous guarantees.},

abstract = {In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly characterize the completely positive transformation between multimeters. However, not all of these transformations between multimeters correspond to valid simulations, as evidenced by the existence of maps that always prepare the same multimeter regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. We give a new definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare. Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations, compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.},

abstract = {A set of classical or quantum states is equivalent to another one if there exists a pair of classical or quantum channels mapping either set to the other one. For dichotomies (pairs of states), this is closely connected to (classical or quantum) Rényi divergences (RD) and the data-processing inequality: If a RD remains unchanged when a channel is applied to the dichotomy, then there is a recovery channel mapping the image back to the initial dichotomy. Here, we prove for classical dichotomies that equality of the RDs alone is already sufficient for the existence of a channel in any of the two directions and discuss some applications. In the quantum case, all families of quantum RDs are seen to be insufficient because they cannot detect anti-unitary transformations. Thus, including anti-unitaries, we pose the problem of finding a sufficient family. It is shown that the Petz and maximal quantum RD are still insufficient in this more general sense and we provide evidence for sufficiency of the minimal quantum RD. As a side result of our techniques, we obtain an infinite list of inequalities fulfilled by the classical, the Petz quantum, and the maximal quantum RDs. These inequalities are not true for the minimal quantum RDs. Our results further imply that any sufficient set of conditions for state transitions in the resource theory of athermality must be able to detect time-reversal.},

abstract = {We establish connections between state tomography, pseudorandomness, quantum state synthesis, and circuit lower bounds. In particular, let C be a family of non-uniform quantum circuits of polynomial size and suppose that there exists an algorithm that, given copies of |ψ⟩, distinguishes whether |ψ⟩ is produced by C or is Haar random, promised one of these is the case. For arbitrary fixed constant c, we show that if the algorithm uses at most O(2^n^c) time and 2^n^0.99 samples then stateBQE⊄stateC. Here stateBQE:=stateBQTIME[2^O(n)] and stateC are state synthesis complexity classes as introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which capture problems with classical inputs but quantum output. Note that efficient tomography implies a similarly efficient distinguishing algorithm against Haar random states, even for nearly exponential-time algorithms. Because every state produced by a polynomial-size circuit can be learned with 2O(n) samples and time, or O(n^ω(1)) samples and 2^O(n^ω(1)) time, we show that even slightly non-trivial quantum state tomography algorithms would lead to new statements about quantum state synthesis. Finally, a slight modification of our proof shows that distinguishing algorithms for quantum states can imply circuit lower bounds for decision problems as well. This help sheds light on why time-efficient tomography algorithms for non-uniform quantum circuit classes has only had limited and partial progress. Our work parallels results by Arunachalam et al. (FOCS 2021) that revealed a similar connection between quantum learning of Boolean functions and circuit lower bounds for classical circuit classes, but modified for the purposes of state tomography and state synthesis.},

abstract = {The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial task in quantum simulation. In this work, we prove that an efficiently implementable dissipative evolution recently introduced by Chen et al. thermalizes into its equilibrium Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or ``thermofield double" states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of Lindbladians for inverse temperatures logarithmic in the system's size is polynomially equivalent to standard quantum computation. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian and the analysis of the stability of its gap. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature of the Laplace transform of the energy observable at fixed runtime, and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that the family of Lindbladians of Chen et al. efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and have the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.},

In this work, we present an error correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit-level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes bivariate bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits.},

abstract = {The entropy accumulation theorem, and its subsequent generalized version, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many device-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of Renyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-Renyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or f-weighted Rényi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well.},

In this work, we conduct a rigorous complexity analysis of the well-conditioned MPF, demonstrating explicit commutator scaling and near-optimal time and precision dependence at the same time. Using our improved complexity analysis, we present several applications of practical interest where the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve a polynomial speedup in both system size and evolution time, as well as an exponential speedup in precision, compared to second-order and even higher-order product formulas. Compared to post-Trotter methods, the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve polynomially better scaling in system size, with only poly-logarithmic overhead in evolution time and precision.},

abstract = {Shallow-depth quantum circuits with gates of bounded fan-in have been demonstrated to achieve computational advantages over shallow-depth classical circuits, even allowing for unbounded fan-in (AC0). Despite their versatility, these computational models are known to be less powerful than Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) circuits, which serve as a natural model for neural networks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and computational capabilities. We prove that PTF circuits with a constant number of layers, when biased (having the activation region of their gates limited), fail to solve certain computational (relational) problems that quantum circuits of constant depth can solve. Furthermore, we prove such a separation for a family of problems, one for each prime qudit dimension. We prove all of these separations via correlation bounds for average-case hardness. We also establish a tight lower bound on the size of biased PTF circuits that can solve a specific relational problem *exactly*. This allows us to significantly reduce the estimated resource requirements for potential demonstrations of quantum advantage. The main challenges in this area of research arise in establishing the classical lower bounds, and in designing non-local games with quantum-classical gaps in the winning strategy in order to go beyond qubits to higher dimensions. To address the former, we have formulated novel switching lemmas specifically designed for multi-output biased PTF circuits, and have developed a way to assess the difficulty of deriving exact solutions. Our contribution towards the latter is grounded in a novel assortment of non-local games, characterized by an exponential difference between their classical and quantum success probabilities. Finally, our technical developments could be of more general and independent interest.},

In this paper, we construct a new family of [[N,K,D]] codes, referred to as hierarchical codes, that encode a number of logical qubits K = Omega(N/łog(N)^2). The N-th element of this code family is obtained by concatenating a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with a surface code; nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions are sufficient to implement the corresponding syndrome-extraction circuit and achieve a threshold. Below threshold the logical failure rate vanishes superpolynomially as a function of the distance D(N). We present a bilayer architecture for implementing the syndrome-extraction circuit, and estimate the logical failure rate for this architecture. Under conservative assumptions, we find that the hierarchical code outperforms the basic encoding where all logical qubits are encoded in the surface code.},

Under the one-sided error requirement, it is known that the permutation test is optimal for this task, and for two input states this coincides with the well-known Swap test. Until now, the optimal measurement in the general two-sided error regime was unknown. Under more specific promises, the problem can be solved approximately or even optimally with simpler tests, such as the circle test. This work attempts to capture the underlying structure of (fine-grained formulations of) the quantum state identity problem. Using tools from semi-definite programming and representation theory, we (i) give an optimal test for any input distribution without the one-sided error requirement by writing the problem as an SDP, giving the exact solutions to the primal and dual programs and showing that the two values coincide; (ii) propose a general G-test which uses an arbitrary subgroup G of S_n, giving an analytic expression of the performance of the specific test, and (iii) give an approximation of the permutation test using only a classical permutation and n−1 Swap tests.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics is that of finding ground states of local Hamiltonians. A number of recent works gave provably efficient machine learning (ML) algorithms for learning ground states. Specifically, [1], introduced an approach for learning properties of the ground state of an n-qubit gapped local Hamiltonian H from data points sampled from Hamiltonians in the same phase of matter polynomial in n. This was subsequently improved by [2], to logarithmic number of samples with respect to system size when the geometry of the n-qubit system is known. In this work, we introduce two approaches that achieve a constant sample complexity, independent of system size, for learning ground state properties. Our first algorithm consists of a simple modification of the ML model used by Lewis et al. and applies to a property of interest known beforehand. Our second algorithm, which applies even if a description of the property is not known, is a deep neural network model. While empirical results showing the performance of neural networks have been demonstrated, to our knowledge, this is the first rigorous sample complexity bound on a neural network model for predicting ground state properties. We also perform numerical experiments that confirm the improved scaling of our approach compared to earlier results.

Since its introduction by Ishizaka and Hiroshima in 2008, no efficient implementation of PBT was known. We close this long-standing gap by building on our recent results on representations of partially transposed permutation matrix algebras and mixed quantum Schur transform. We construct efficient quantum algorithms for probabilistic and deterministic PBT protocols on n ports of arbitrary local dimension, both for EPR and optimized resource states. We describe two constructions based on different encodings of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for n qudits: a standard encoding that achieves O(n) time and O(nlog(n)) space complexity, and a Yamanouchi encoding that achieves O(n^2) time and O(log(n)) space complexity, both for constant local dimension and target error. We also describe efficient circuits for preparing the optimal resource states.},

abstract = {We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. 
These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. 
The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. 
The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. 
The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. 
The simplest non-trivial example is a fault-tolerant circuit for the double-semion phase, defined on the same set of qubits as the stabilizer toric code, with $12$ controlled-$S$ gates in addition to the $8$ controlled-$X$ gates and $2$ single-qubit measurements of the toric code per spacetime unit cell. 
We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. 
As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. 
This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases.},

abstract = {Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.},

Our result assumes the existence of a `good' approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a crucial ingredient in former area-law proofs. Such approximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians. As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any $eps&gt;0$ and any bi-partition $Lcup L^c$ of the system, beginalign* I^eps_max(L:L^c)_Ømega łe bigO łog (|L|) + łog(1/eps), endalign* where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$ and $I^eps_max(L:L^c)_Ømega$ represents the $eps$-emphsmoothed maximum mutual information with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition in Ω. From this bound we then conclude $I(L:L^c)_Ømega łe bigOłog(|L|)$ – an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that Ω can be approximated up to an $eps$ in trace norm with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $poly(|L|/eps)$. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.},

analyze property testing of free-fermionic states, specifically the task of determining, through measurements,

bounds on the sample complexity for tomography of pure free-fermionic states, and we also generalize the

by new insights into fermionic Gaussian states: Specifically, we show bounds on the minimum trace distance 
between a state and the set of free-fermionic states, which also serve as efficiently computable measures of 
‘non-Gaussianity’ for the state. Furthermore, we derive useful bounds on the trace distance between two possibly mixed free-fermionic states in terms of the norm difference of their correlation matrices},

Given an observable and an initial state, the goal is to tune the control variables so that the expected value of some observable with respect to the final state is maximized. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving this optimal control problem efficiently, i.e., having a poly-logarithmic dependency on the system dimension, which is exponentially faster than best-known classical algorithms. Our algorithms are hybrid, consisting of both quantum and classical components. The quantum procedure simulates time-dependent Lindblad evolution that drives the initial state to the final state, and it also provides access to the gradients of the objective function via quantum gradient estimation. The classical procedure uses the gradient information to update the control variables. At the technical level, we provide the first (to the best of our knowledge) simulation al- gorithm for time-dependent Lindbladians with an ℓ1-norm dependence. As an alternative, we also present a simulation algorithm in the interaction picture to improve the algorithm for the cases where the time-independent component of a Lindbladian dominates the time-dependent part. On the classical side, we heavily adapt the state-of-the-art classical optimization analysis to interface with the quantum part of our algorithms.

By using simple commutation rules, a quantum circuit can be transpiled into a sequence of solely non-Clifford multi-qubit gates. Prior work on fault-tolerant compilation avoids optimal scheduling of such gates since they reduce the parallelizability of the circuit. We observe that the reduced parallelization potential is outweighed by the significant reduction in the number of gates. We therefore devise a method for scheduling multi-qubit lattice surgery using an earliest-available-first policy, solving the associated forest packing problem using a representation of the multi-qubit gates as Steiner trees. Our extensive testing on random and application-inspired circuits demonstrates the method's scalability and performance. We show that the transpilation significantly reduces the circuit length on the set of circuits tested, and that the resulting circuit of multi-qubit gates has a further reduction in the expected circuit execution time compared to serial execution.},

This includes rigorous but easy-to-work-with definitions and algorithms for the fault distance and hook faults for stabilizer channels. The generalized notion of hook faults which we introduce, defined with respect to an arbitrary subset of a circuit’s faults rather than a fixed phenomenological noise model, can be leveraged for fault-tolerant circuit design. Additionally, we establish necessary conditions such that channel composition preserves the fault distance.

Recent work has focused on developing approximation algorithms for local Hamiltonians, and in particular the ``Quantum Max Cut'' (QMaxCut) problem, which is closely related to the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. In this work, we introduce a family of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations based on the Navascues-Pironio-Acin (NPA) hierarchy which is tailored for QMaxCut by taking into account its SU(2) symmetry. We show that the hierarchy converges to the optimal QMaxCut value at a finite level, which is based on a characterization of the algebra of SWAP operators. We give several analytic proofs and computational results showing exactness/inexactness of our hierarchy at the lowest level on several important families of graphs. We also discuss relationships between SDP approaches for QMaxCut and frustration-freeness in condensed matter physics and numerically demonstrate that the SDP-solvability practically becomes an efficiently-computable generalization of frustration-freeness. Furthermore, by numerical demonstration we show the potential of SDP algorithms to perform as an approximate method to compute physical quantities and capture physical features of some Heisenberg-type statistical mechanics models even away from the frustration-free regions.},

We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer R'enyi entropy—a recent proposal for a magic measure for multi-qubit states. With this in hand, we give a classical simulation algorithm with runtime scaling with the resource contents, quantified by our magic measures. We also employ our results to prove that implementing a multi-qubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with much non-Gaussianity.},

abstract = {Harnessing quantum effects in metrology, such as entanglement and coherence, enables enhanced sensitivity in measuring parameters. Despite this, decoherence and time-dependent errors can undermine Heisenberg-limited amplification. To navigate these challenges in realistic experiments for phase estimation of a two-level unitary gate, we introduce a suite of quantum metrology algorithms. These algorithms capitalize on the universality of quantum signal transformation to decouple two interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Our approach combines provably optimal classical estimation with nearly optimal quantum circuit design, achieving unparalleled accuracy of 10−4 radians in standard deviation for estimating extremely small angles in superconducting qubit experiments with low-depth (&lt; 10) circuits. This accuracy surpasses existing alternatives by two orders of magnitude and is adaptable to ion trap gates. We prove both theoretically and numerically the optimality of our algorithm against time-dependent phase error in φ. Remarkably, in the low circuit depth limit, our method’s estimation variance on the time-sensitive parameter φ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg limit as a function of depth, Var(φˆ) ∼ 1/d4. Crucially, our method’s efficacy is rigorously affirmed through an analysis against the quantum Fisher information, a feature lacking in prior art. This analysis underpins our protocol’s ability to achieve unmatched precision, leveraging quantum resources more effectively than has been possible before.},

We propose an effective state purification gadget with a moderate quantum overhead by projecting multiple noisy quantum inputs to their symmetry subspace defined by a set of projectors forming a subgroup of the symmetry group. This provides a state purification performance scaling inverse-linearly to the number of state copies given a fixed stochastic error rate, which drastically improves the implementation overhead in previous works.

abstract = {We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an L1-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical numerical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features/predictors d is possible by using the simple quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Dürr and Høyer [1] in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features d and the number of observations n by using the recent approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Chen and de Wolf [2]. In order to do so, we construct, as one of our main contributions, a quantum unitary based on quantum amplitude estimation to approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine. Since the joining times are no longer exactly computed, it is no longer clear that the resulting approximate quantum algorithm obtains a good solution. As our second main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and therefore our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are only approximately computed. Finally, in the model where the observations are generated by an underlying linear model with an unknown coefficient vector, we prove bounds on the difference between the unknown coefficient vector and the approximate Lasso solution, which generalises known results about convergence rates in classical statistical learning theory analysis.

This ceases to be true in quantum learning, where many settings admit neither an SQ nor a quantum statistical query (QSQ) analog. In this work, we take inspiration from Kearns' SQ oracle and Valiant's weak evaluation oracle (TOCT'14) to unify statistical and parametrized learning. We present a systematic study of the problem of learning from an evaluation oracle, which provides an estimate of function values, and extend Feldman's framework for SQ learning (COLT'17) to our setting. This leads to unconditional lower bounds and a characterization of learning linear function classes which are directly applicable to the QSQ setting and virtually any algorithm based on loss function optimization. Our first application is to extend prior results on the learnability of quantum states and their output distributions from the SQ to the (multi-copy) QSQ setting, implying exponential separations between learning stabilizer states from (multi-copy) QSQ's versus from quantum samples. Our second application is to analyze and dissect the hardness of quantum machine learning (QML). We gain a broad understanding of the hardness of various QML tasks, which goes beyond the intuition of barren plateaus and enables us to separate the implications of barren plateaus depending on the context in which they appear.},

abstract = {Entanglement is one of the fundamental properties of a quantum state and is a crucial differentiator between classical and quantum computation. There are many ways to define entanglement and its measure, depending on the problem or application under consideration. Each of these measures may be computed or approximated by multiple methods. However, hardly any of these methods can be run on near-term quantum hardware. This work presents a quantum adaptation of the iterative higher-order power method for estimating the geometric measure of entanglement of multi-qubit pure states using rank-1 tensor approximation. This method is executable on current (hybrid) quantum hardware and does not depend on quantum memory. We study the effect of noise on the algorithm using a simple theoretical model based on the standard depolarising channel. This model allows us to post hoc mitigate the effects of noise on the results of the computation.},

abstract = {In recent years, the study of Bell-type nonlocality on networks has led to an array of intriguing foundational results, most strongly illustrated by nonlocality without the need for inputs, i.e. each party in the network can conduct the same measurement in each round. Nonetheless the field still faces difficulties in finding a justified application. One of the key barriers for this is the assumption of independent sources in network nonlocality, which is difficult to enforce. In our work we examine a possible operational interpretation for such independent sources. In particular, in networks without inputs, parties connected with a common classical source can be interpreted as malicious parties working together. We explore the first steps in this framework and show that there exist nonlocal distributions which are robust against the topology of the network, i.e. in the spirit of decentralized protocols, the overall distributions are nonlocal even if one is unsure which parties are collaborating. In fact, even in large networks nonlocality is topologically robust when assuming information only about a constant-sized region of the network's connectivity, namely only the connectivity of 2 or 3 parties. We further examine the relation to randomness generation and highlight some remaining challenges in topological considerations in network nonlocality.},

abstract = {Understanding equilibration behavior of closed systems is an important but difficult problem. 
Intuitively, after some equilibration time, many-body systems typically transition to a steady state, in which expectation values become stationary. 
Sometimes, after long evolution times, however, a system can exit an equilibrium state again. 
Thus, it is natural to ask (i) for how long is an expectation value of a time-evolved observable &lt;O(t)&gt; equilibrated and (ii) what are the extremal values of &lt;O(t)&gt;. For simple observables and states under k-local Hamiltonian dynamics we show that the associated computational problems are (i) coNEXP-complete and (ii) NEXP-complete to answer for time scales given in scientific notation. 
Thus, no classical polynomial-time algorithm exist for these problems (unconditionally). Hence, understanding equilibration behavior of closed systems can be computationally intractable. 
We then show a similar result for estimating the ansatz error for a VQA setup, in which one can potentially reuse gate generators an arbitary number of times. 
Hence, we provide arguably rare examples of physically motivated NEXP-complete problems. Finally, we also derive upper bounds for the question of equilibration over all time. Here we show that the computational problem is contained in a subclass of EXPSPACE i.e. solvable in exponential space, but potentially double-exponential time.},

abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum computers could facilitate the simulation of quantum systems unfeasible for classical computation. However, the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices of the present and near-term are limited, and their utilization requires additional strategies. These include quantum error mitigation (QEM) for alleviating device noise and variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which combine classical optimization with short-depth parameterized quantum circuits. We compare two such methods: zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) with noise amplification by circuit folding, and incremental structural learning (ISL), a type of circuit recompiling VQA. These are applied to trotterized time-evolution of the Tavis-Cummings model (TCM) under a noise simulation. Since both methods add circuit evaluation overhead, it is of interest to see how they compare both in the accuracy of the dynamics they produce, and in terms of the quantum resources used. Additionally, noisy recompilation of time-evolution circuits with ISL has not previously been explored to our knowledge. We find that while ISL achieves lower error than ZNE for smaller system sizes, it fails to produce correct dynamics for 4 qubits, where ZNE is superior. Diverging resource requirements for ISL and ZNE are observed, with ISL achieving low circuit depths at the cost of a large number of circuit evaluations.},

abstract = {In this work, we consider a fundamental task in quantum many-body physics – finding and learning ground states of quantum Hamiltonians and their properties. 
 Recent works have studied the task of predicting the ground state expectation value of sums of geometrically local observables by learning from data. For short-range gapped Hamiltonians, a sample complexity that is logarithmic in the number of qubits and quasipolynomial in the error was obtained. 
 Here we extend these results beyond the local requirements on both Hamiltonians and observables, motivated by the relevance of long-range interactions in molecular and atomic systems. For interactions decaying as a power law with exponent greater than twice the dimension of the system, we recover the same efficient logarithmic scaling with respect to the number of qubits, but the dependence on the error worsens to exponential. 
 Further, we show that learning algorithms equivariant under the automorphism group of the interaction hypergraph achieve a sample complexity reduction, leading in particular to a constant number of samples for learning sums of local observables in systems with periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the efficient scaling in practice by learning from DMRG simulations of 1D long-range and disordered systems with up to 128 qubits. Finally, we provide an analysis of the concentration of expectation values of global observables stemming from the central limit theorem, resulting in increased prediction accuracy.},

While matching the optimal locality properties of ternary trees, the Sierpinski tree mapping has the additional benefit of encoding the fermionic states as computational basis states. This is analogous to the reformulation of the Bravyi-Kitaev encoding in terms of Fenwick trees. In the classical setting, Fenwick trees see use in applications that require storing and dynamically updating data in an array, as well as efficiently calculating prefix sums. They accomplish these operations in $O(łog_2 N)$ time. We show that our ``quantum-inspired'' Sierpinski trees are strictly better, accomplishing them in $O(łog_3 N)$ time instead. Using the connection to the ternary tree encoding, we prove this order to be optimal.},

abstract = {What is the power of polynomial-time quantum computation with access to an NP oracle? In this work, we focus on two fundamental tasks from the study of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems: search-to-decision reductions, and approximate counting. We first show that, in strong contrast to the classical setting where a poly-time Turing machine requires Θ(n) queries to an NP oracle to compute a witness to a given SAT formula, quantumly Θ(logn) queries suffice. We then show this is tight in the black-box model - any quantum algorithm with "NP-like" query access to a formula requires Ω(logn) queries to extract a solution with constant probability. Moving to approximate counting of SAT solutions, by exploiting a quantum link between search-to-decision reductions and approximate counting, we show that existing classical approximate counting algorithms are likely optimal. First, we give a lower bound in the "NP-like" black-box query setting: Approximate counting requires Ω(logn) queries, even on a quantum computer. We then give a "white-box" lower bound (i.e. where the input formula is not hidden in the oracle) - if there exists a randomized poly-time classical or quantum algorithm for approximate counting making o(logn) NP queries, then BPP^NP[o(n)] contains a P^NP-complete problem if the algorithm is classical and FBQP^NP[o(n)] contains an FP^NP-complete problem if the algorithm is quantum.},

In this work we extend the stabilizer formalism using the local-dimension-invariant setting to import stabilizer codes from these standard local-dimensions to other cases. In particular, we show that any traditional stabilizer code can be used for analog continuous-variable codes, and consider restrictions in phase space and discretized phase space. This puts this framework on an equivalent footing as traditional stabilizer codes. Following this, using extensions of prior ideas, we show that a stabilizer code originally designed with a finite field local-dimension can be transformed into a code with the same n, k, and d parameters for any integral domain. This is of theoretical interest and can be of use for systems whose local-dimension is better described by mathematical rings, which permits the use of traditional stabilizer codes for protecting their information as well.},

abstract = {Unpredictable functions (UPFs) play essential roles in classical cryptography, including message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures. In this paper, we introduce a quantum analog of UPFs, which we call unpredictable state generators (UPSGs). UPSGs are implied by pseudorandom function-like states generators (PRFSs), which are a quantum analog of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and therefore UPSGs could exist even if one-way functions do not exist,similar to other recently introduced primitives like pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs), one-way state generators (OWSGs), and EFIs. In classical cryptography, UPFs are equivalent to PRFs, but in the quantum case, the equivalence is not clear, and UPSGs could be weaker than PRFSs. Despite this, we demonstrate that all known applications of PRFSs are also achievable with UPSGs. They include IND-CPA-secure secret-key encryption and EUFCMA-secure MACs with unclonable tags. Our findings suggest that, for many applications, quantum unpredictability, rather than quantum pseudorandomness, is sufficient.},

More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial state and queries to a specific unitary matrix, our algorithm is able to recover the phase with a total runtime O(ϵ−1poly log(ϵ−1)), where ϵ is the desired accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies Tmaxϵ ≪ π, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms, and our algorithm is also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling and state preparation},

We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks in performing a classical sequence modeling task. Furthermore, each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs is computationally efficient, implementable in constant time on a quantum device. The classical networks we prove a separation over include well-known examples such as recurrent neural networks and Transformers. We show that quantum contextuality is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations may be a regime where practical advantages in quantum machine learning may exist.},

abstract = {We present quantum algorithms for sampling from non-logconcave probability distributions in the form of π(x)∝exp(−βf(x)). Here, f can be written as a finite sum f(x):=1N∑Nk=1fk(x). Our approach is based on quantum simulated annealing on slowly varying Markov chains derived from unadjusted Langevin algorithms, removing the necessity for function evaluations which can be computationally expensive for large data sets in mixture modeling and multi-stable systems. We also incorporate a stochastic gradient oracle that implements the quantum walk operators inexactly by only using mini-batch gradients. As a result, our stochastic gradient based algorithm only accesses small subsets of data points in implementing the quantum walk. One challenge of quantizing the resulting Markov chains is that they do not satisfy the detailed balance condition in general. Consequently, the mixing time of the algorithm cannot be expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the transition density, making the quantum algorithms nontrivial to analyze. To overcome these challenges, we first build a hypothetical Markov chain that is reversible, and also converges to the target distribution. Then, we quantified the distance between our algorithm's output and the target distribution by using this hypothetical chain as a bridge to establish the total complexity. Our quantum algorithms exhibit polynomial speedups in terms of both dimension and precision dependencies when compared to the best-known classical algorithms.},

abstract = {Group twirling is crucial in quantum information processing, particularly in randomized benchmarking and randomized compiling. While protocols based on Pauli twirling have been effectively crafted to transform arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels for Clifford gates — thereby facilitating efficient benchmarking and mitigating worst-case errors — the lack of practical twirling groups for multi-qubit non-Clifford gates remains a challenge. To address this gap, we study the issue of finding twirling groups for generic quantum gates, focusing on a widely used circuit structure in randomized benchmarking or randomized compiling. Specifically, for multi-qubit-controlled phase gates, which are essential in quantum algorithms and directly implementable in practice, we determine optimal twirling groups within the realm of classically replaceable unitary operations. Contrasting with the local Pauli twirling group for Clifford gates, the optimal groups for such gates contain nonlocal operations, highlighting the overhead of tailoring noise in global non-Clifford contexts. We design new benchmarking procedures for multi-qubit controlled phase gates based on the optimal twirling groups. Our simulation results show that our scheme can improve the precision and accuracy of benchmarking in small-scale systems.},

abstract = {In unitary property testing a quantum algorithm, also known as a tester, is given query access to a black-box unitary and has to decide whether it satisfies some property. We propose a new technique for proving lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of unitary property testing and related problems, which utilises the connection between unitary property testing and unitary channel discrimination. The main advantage of this technique is that all obtained lower bounds hold for any C-tester with C contained in QMA(2)/qpoly, showing that even having access to textitboth (unentangled) quantum proofs and advice does not help for many unitary problems. We apply our technique to prove lower bounds for problems like quantum phase estimation, the entanglement entropy problem, quantum Gibbs sampling and more, removing all logarithmic factors in the lower bounds obtained by the sample-to-query lifting theorem of Wang and Zhang (2023). As a direct corollary, we show that there exist quantum oracles relative to which QMA(2) and QMA/qpoly do not contain SBQP and SBQP. The former shows that, at least in a black-box way, having unentangled quantum proofs does not help in solving problems that require high precision.},

Further, we obtain hardness of approximation results for approximating probability amplitudes of quantum circuits and partition functions of quantum spin systems. This establishes a computational complexity transition for these problems and shows that our algorithmic conditions are optimal under complexity-theoretic assumptions.

abstract = {Quantum theory promises computational speed-ups than classical means. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill Theorem implies that the full power of quantum computation resides in the specific resource of ``magic'' states — the secret sauce to establish universal quantum computation. However, it is still questionable whether ``magic'' indeed brings the believed quantum advantage, ridding unproven complexity assumptions or black-box oracles. In this work, we demonstrate the first unconditional magic advantage: a separation between the power of generic constant-depth or ``shallow'' quantum circuits and magic-free counterparts. For this purpose, we link the shallow circuit computation with the strongest form of quantum nonlocality — quantum ``pseudo-telepathy,'' where distant non-communicating observers generate perfectly synchronous statistics. We prove quantum magic is indispensable for such correlated statistics in a specific nonlocal game inspired by the linear binary constraint system. Then, we translate generating quantum pseudo-telepathy into a relation problem, where magic is necessary for a shallow circuit to solve it perfectly. As a by-product, we provide an efficient algorithm to solve a general linear binary constraint system over the Pauli group, in contrast to the broad undecidability in constraint systems. We anticipate our results will enlighten the final establishment of the unconditional advantage of universal quantum computation.},

Nonetheless, the problem of identifying entanglement has still not reached a general solution for systems larger than 2x3. Modern deep learning (DL) architectures, that use multilayer neural networks (NNs), have enabled unprecedented achievements in various domains like computer vision or natural language processing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with many hidden layers and complex network structures are extremely powerful in feature learning: they easily outperform classical algorithms in image classification, object detection, or face recognition tasks. In quantum physics, one natural application of DL involves the study of quantum many-body systems, where the extreme complexity of many-body states often makes theoretical analysis intractable. Nonetheless, employment of machine learning in physics for entangled state representations is typically focused on more traditional architectures such as Boltzmann machines or fully connected NNs. However, there are recent signals that deep CNNs can better represent highly entangled quantum systems. I will present our recent research on entanglement detection using modern deep neural network architectures (CNNs, Siamese networks, autoencoders), closer to the state-of-the-art approaches in DL, trained in a supervised and unsupervised manner and compare them in terms of their suitability for building robust entanglement detectors.},

The images of such linear maps are called the testing regions of the corresponding model or measurement. Testing regions are notoriously impractical to treat analytically in the quantum case. Our first result is to provide an implicit outer approximation of the testing region of any given quantum statistical model or measurement in any finite dimension: namely, a region in probability space that contains the desired image, but is defined implicitly, using a formula that depends only on the given model or measurement. The outer approximation that we construct is minimal among all such outer approximations, and close, in the sense that it becomes the maximal inner approximation up to a constant scaling factor. Finally, we apply our approximation formulas to characterize, in a semi-device independent way, the ability to transform one quantum statistical model or measurement into another.},

abstract = {Constructing Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators such that they satisfy constraints is an important ansatz construction for many quantum algorithms. In this manuscript, we give general algebraic expressions for finding Hamiltonian terms and analogously unitary primitives, that satisfy constraint embeddings and use these to give complexity characterizations of the related problems. While finding operators with classical symmetries is proven to be NP-Complete in the general case, we also give an algorithmic procedure with worse-case polynomial runtime to find any operators with a constant locality bound; a useful result since many symmetries imposed admit local operators to enforce them in practice. We then give algorithmic procedures to turn these algebraic primitives into Hamiltonian drivers and unitary mixers that can be used for Constrained Quantum Annealing (CQA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) constructions by tackling practical problems related to finding an appropriate set of reduced generators and defining corresponding drivers and mixers accordingly. We then apply these concepts to the construction of ansaetze for 1-in-3 SAT instances. We consider the ordinary x-mixer QAOA, a novel QAOA approach based on the maximally disjoint subset, and a QAOA approach based on the disjoint subset as well as higher order constraint satisfaction terms. We empirically benchmark these approaches on instances sized between 12 and 22, showing the best relative performance for the tailored ansaetze and that exponential curve fits on the results are consistent with a quadratic speedup by utilizing alternative ansaetze to the x-mixer. We provide very general algorithmic prescriptions for finding driver or mixing terms that satisfy embedded constraints that can be utilized to probe quantum speedups for constraints problems with linear, quadratic, or even higher order polynomial constraints.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a novel approach to investigating entanglement in the context of quantum computing. Our methodology involves analyzing reduced density matrices at different stages of a quantum algorithm's execution and representing the dominant eigenvalue and von Neumann entropy on a graph, creating an "entanglement trajectory." To establish the trajectory's boundaries, we employ random matrix theory. Through the examination of examples such as quantum adiabatic computation, the Grover algorithm, and the Shor algorithm, we demonstrate that the entanglement trajectory remains within the established boundaries, exhibiting unique characteristics for each example. Moreover, we show that these boundaries and features can be extended to trajectories defined by alternative entropy measures. The entanglement trajectory serves as an invariant property of a quantum system, maintaining consistency across varying situations and definitions of entanglement. Numerical simulations accompanying this research are available via open access.},

abstract = {Analog quantum simulation is an important routine for quantum computing and plays a crucial role in studying quantum many-body physics. 
Typically, the quantum evolution of an analog simulator is largely determined by its physical characteristics, lacking the precise control or versatility of quantum gates. This limitation poses challenges in measuring specific observables on analog quantum simulators, which is the final step of all quantum information processing tasks. 
To address this issue, we introduce the Hamiltonian shadow protocol. This method uses a single quench Hamiltonian for estimating arbitrary state properties, eliminating the need for ancillary systems. 
We provide physical intuitions and theoretical guarantees for our protocol. Additionally, we derive the sample complexity of this protocol and show that it performs comparably to the classical shadow protocol. The Hamiltonian shadow protocol does not require sophisticated control and can be applied to a wide range of analog quantum simulators. We demonstrate its utility through numerical demonstrations with Rydberg atom arrays under realistic parameter settings. The new protocol significantly broadens the application of randomized measurements for analog quantum simulators without precise control and ancillary systems.},

Furthermore, we show the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions.

abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to speed-up important matrix-arithmetic tasks. A prominent framework for that is the quantum singular-value transformation (QSVT) formalism, which uses Chebyshev approximations and coherent access to the input matrix via a unitary block encoding to design a target matrix function. Nonetheless, physical implementations for useful end-user applications require large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we present a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Monte-Carlo simulation of generic matrix functions more amenable to early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. Serving from the ideas of QSVT, we randomize over the Chebyshev polynomials while keeping the matrix oracle quantum. The method is assisted by a variant of the Hadamard test that removes the need for post-selection. As a result, it features a similar statistical overhead to the fully quantum case of standard QSVT and does not incur any circuit depth degradation. On the contrary, the average circuit depth is shown to get smaller, yielding equivalent reductions of noise sensitivity, as we explicitly show for depolarizing noise and coherent errors. We apply our technique to four specific use cases: partition-function estimation via quantum Markov-chain Monte Carlo and via imaginary-time evolution; end-to-end linear system solvers; and ground-state energy estimation. For these cases, we prove advantages on average depths, including quadratic speed-ups on costly parameters and even the removal of the approximation-error dependence. All in all, our framework provides a pathway towards early fault-tolerant quantum linear algebra applications.},

abstract = {Quantum technologies rely heavily on accurate control and reliable readout of quantum systems. Current experiments are limited by numerous sources of noise that can only be partially captured by simple analytical models and additional characterization of the noise sources is required. We test the ability of readout error mitigation to correct realistic noise found in systems composed of quantum two-level objects (qubits). To probe the limit of such methods, we designed a universal readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state tomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and quantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement procedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state tomography the method becomes largely device-, architecture-, noise source-, and quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting qubit and benchmark the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We characterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources, such as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon population, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened T1 and T2 decay times. As a result, we identified noise sources for which readout error mitigation worked well, and observed decreases in readout infidelity by a factor of up to 30.},

abstract = {Abstract Noisy quantum computers introduce bias to the measured expectation values. Quantum error mitigation recovers the correct values by generally trading off the bias for an increase in the statistical variance of the measurement. Among error mitigation approaches, Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) stands out as a method capable of eliminating all potential bias due to gate errors, in exchange for an exponentially large variance of the estimator. This variance can be significantly reduced by not mitigating errors lying outside the causal lightcone of the desired observable. The causal lightcone, however, can grossly overestimate the support of a spreading operator. Here, we improve the lightcone approach by assigning upper bounds that limit how much each error channel in the circuit can bias the expectation value. This set of bounds, which we refer to as a "shaded lightcone," enables a targeted application of PEC, improving the tradespace of bias and variance. We present an efficient algorithm that leverages the locality of errors to compute the bounds, providing a practical benefit even with modest classical resources. As an example, demonstrate the algorithm to the error mitigation of a 127-qubit Trotter circuit, reducing the sampling overhead by several orders of magnitude compared to PEC based on the causal lightcone.},

abstract = {Bell's theorem proves that some quantum state correlations can only be explained by bipartite non-classical resources. The notion of genuinely multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) was later introduced to conceptualize the fact that nonclassical resources involving more than two parties in a nontrivial way may be needed to account for some quantum correlations. In this letter, we first recall the contradictions inherent to the historical definition of GMNL. Second, we turn to one of its redefinitions, called Local-Operations-and-Shared-Randomness GMNL (LOSR-GMNL), proving that all caterpillar graph states (including cluster states) have this second property. Finally, we conceptualize a third, alternative definition, which we call Local-Operations-and-Neighbour-Communication GMNL (LONC-GMNL), that is adapted to situations in which short-range communication between some parties might occur. We show that cluster states do not have this third property, while GHZ states do. Beyond its technical content, our letter illustrates that rigorous conceptual work is needed before applying the concepts of genuinely multipartite nonlocality, genuine multipartite entanglement or entanglement depth to benchmark the nonclassicality of some experimentally-produced quantum system. We note that most experimental works still use witnesses based on the historical definitions of these notions, which fail to reject models based on bipartite resources.},

abstract = {We consider the scenario in which a black box with buttons and light bulbs is given so that, if any button is pressed a certain number of times, the corresponding probability distribution on the light bulbs lighting up can be observed. We model the black box as a prepare-and-measure setup, that is, an unspecified state is prepared upon the pressure of any button, and an unspecified measurement is performed on such a state. 
We consider the problem of the Bayesian inference of, say, the measurement (but, of course, we could consider the dual problem of inferring the states), that is, we aim at finding the measurement that maximizes the Bayesian posterior probability density, given the observations, for any given prior probability density on states and measurements. 
Our main result is to characterize such optimal measurements in the informationally complete (IC) case when uniform probability densities (i.e. maximal ignorance) are assumed on states and measurements. In particular, we prove that any measurement that produces the observations upon the input of a 2-design set of states is optimal, thus settling in closed-form the case of non-overcomplete measurements, for which the only 2-design is the symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) set of states. Being data-driven, the inferential setup we consider offers a solution to the chicken-or-egg problem of usual quantum tomography, that is, the fact that the tomography of a measurement requires the knowledge of the input states, whereas the tomography of the states requires the knowledge of the measurement, in a neverending loop.},

abstract = {Quantum phase estimation is one of the fundamental primitives that underpins many quantum algorithms, including quantum amplitude estimation, the HHL algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, and quantum principal component analysis. Due to its significance as a subroutine, in this work, we study the coherent version of the phase estimation problem, where given an arbitrary input state and black-box access to unitaries U and controlled-U, the goal is to estimate the phases of U in superposition. Unlike most existing phase estimation algorithms, which employ intermediary measurements steps that inevitably destroy coherence, only a couple of algorithms, including the well-known standard quantum phase estimation algorithm, consider this coherent setting. In this work, we propose an improved version of this standard algorithm that utilizes tapering/window functions. Our algorithm, which we call tapered quantum phase estimation algorithm, achieves the optimal query complexity (total number of calls to U and controlled-U) without requiring the use of a computationally expensive quantum sorting network for median computation, which the standard algorithm uses to boost the success probability arbitrarily close to one. We also show that the tapering functions that we use are optimal by formulating optimization problems with different optimization criteria. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we also provide non-asymptotic query complexity of our algorithm, as it is crucial for practical implementation. Finally, we also propose an efficient algorithm that prepares the quantum state corresponding to the optimal tapering function.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics is that non-orthogonal states cannot be distinguished perfectly. When distinguishing multiple copies of a mixed quantum state, a collective measurement, which generates entanglement between the different copies of the unknown state, can achieve a lower error probability than non-entangling measurements. The error probability that can be attained using a collective measurement on M copies of the unknown state is given by the M-copy Helstrom bound. In the limit where we can perform a collective measurement on asymptotically many copies of the quantum state, the quantum Chernoff bound gives the error exponent. We first examine the conditions for when collective measurements offer an advantage over non-entangling measurements. Surprisingly, we find that whether collective measurements offer an advantage or not can depend on the prior probabilities of the different states. Using this, we implement on a superconducting quantum computer, the first case of a collective measurement surpassing the limits set by non-entangling measurements [1]. 
We then examine the attainability of the quantum Chernoff bound. Specifically we ask whether the asymptotic error exponent can be reached with a measurement on any finite number of copies and at what rate does the error tend to the asymptotic limit. We find analytic expressions for the Helstrom bound for arbitrary many copies of the unknown state in several simple qubit examples. Using these analytic expressions, we investigate how the attainable error exponent changes as we allow collective measurements on finite numbers of copies of the quantum state. Finally, using parameterised quantum circuits, we investigate the necessary conditions to saturate the M-copy Helstrom bound [1] Conlon, L. O., Eilenberger, F., Lam, P. K. & Assad, S. M.

In particular, realizing complex many-body phenomena such as dynamical lattice gauge theories (LGTs) requires implementation of multi-body interactions that are typically not directly available in natural Hamiltonians. We introduce and analyze a novel Hamiltonian engineering technique based on time-dependent control. Our approach leverages controlled perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as a resource for operator spreading, and uses these time-evolved operators as a basis to realize a broad class of complex multi-body interactions with tunable coefficients. We apply this framework to the neutral atom array platform, to engineer dynamics within the constrained "Rydberg-blockaded" subspace in two settings. First, we show how blockade-consistent exchange interactions on a one-dimensional chain can be engineered, enabling exploration of novel phases with emergent particle number conservation and interesting dynamics of multi-partite entanglement. Second, we demonstrate our ability to implement multi-body ring-exchange interactions in a two-dimensional setting, and present a realistic proposal for investigating unexplored regimes in non-equilibrium dynamics of 2D LGTs.},

abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erdös–Rényi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-q-XORSAT on an Erdös–Rényi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure q-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-q-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure q-spin model for even q≥4 is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model to be true.},

abstract = {Identification of possible transformations of quantum objects including quantum states and quantum operations is indispensable in developing quantum algorithms. Universal transformations, defined as input-independent transformations, appear in various quantum applications. Such is the case for universal transformations of unitary operations. However, extending these transformations to non-unitary operations is nontrivial and largely unresolved. Addressing this, we introduce isometry adjointation protocols that convert an input isometry operation into its adjoint operation, which include both unitary operation and quantum state transformations. The paper details the construction of parallel and sequential isometry adjointation protocols, derived from unitary inversion protocols using quantum combs, and achieving optimal approximation error. This error is shown to be independent of the output dimension of the isometry operation. In particular, we explicitly obtain an asymptotically optimal parallel protocol achieving an approximation error ε = Θ(d^2/n), where d is the input dimension of the isometry operation and n is the number of calls of the isometry operation. The research also extends to isometry inversion and universal error detection, employing semidefinite programming to assess optimal performances. The findings suggest that the optimal performance of general protocols in isometry adjointation and universal error detection is not dependent on the output dimension, and that indefinite causal order protocols offer advantages over sequential ones in isometry inversion and universal error detection.},

A combination of numerical simulations and experiments on programmable superconducting quantum circuits provides further evidence that global depolarising noise is an excellent back-of-the-envelope predictive model. The monitoring of entropy density not only provides a complementary approach to existing circuit-level benchmarking techniques, but more importantly, it provides a much needed bridge between circuit-level and application-level benchmarking protocols. Our work shows that the combination of analytical, numerical and experimental methods, has the potential to build good heuristic models that improve over existing techniques to bound the circuit size above which quantum advantage is lost.},

abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computing is a general framework for preparing eigenstates of Hamiltonians on quantum devices. However, its digital implementation requires an efficient Hamiltonian simulation subroutine, which may introduce extra computational overhead or complicated quantum control logic. Here we establish general methodology of analyzing various numerical methods for discretizing near-adiabatic quantum dynamics. According to our analysis, the time step sizes in time discretization can be much larger than expected, and the overall complexity is greatly reduced. Remarkably, regardless of the general convergence order of the numerical method, we can choose a uniform time step size independent of tolerated error and evolution time for sufficiently accurate simulation. Furthermore, with the boundary cancellation condition where the continuous diabatic errors are exponentially suppressed, even first-order Trotter with uniform time step size can achieve exponential convergence. We apply our analysis to the example of adiabatic unstructured search and show several preferable features of the Trotterrized adiabatic approach: it can match the Grover lower bound, it does not require a priori knowledge on the number of marked states, and its performance can be asymptotically comparable with that of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.},

abstract = {The area law of the bipartite information measure is crucial in understanding quantum many-body physics and quantum information science. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions, and it is called the thermal area law. Contrary to this, for long-range interacting systems with power-law interactions, $r^-alpha$ (where $r$ is the distance), determining when the thermal area law applies is less clear. In this work, we clarify the optimal condition $alpha&gt; alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. Typically, examining the strength of the interaction across the boundary of two subsystems helps to identify these conditions. However, our findings suggest that the thermal area law is more robust than previously thought. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Intriguingly, this threshold also includes thermodynamically unstable scenarios where $alpha &lt; D$. Moreover, we prove a power-law clustering theorem for $alpha &gt; D$ to achieve an unconditional proof of the thermal area law above a certain temperature. We have validated this threshold through numerical simulations in both integrable and non-integrable systems. Our numerical studies on logarithmic negativity confirm that the same condition $alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.},

abstract = {Error corrected quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational problems. Quantum error correction involves repeated rounds of carefully scheduled gates to measure the stabilizers of a code. A set of scheduling rules is typically imposed on the order of gates to ensure that the circuit can be rearranged into an equivalent circuit that can be easily seen to measure the stabilizers. In this work, we ask what would happen if we break these rules and instead use circuit schedules that we describe as tangled. We find that tangling schedules generates long-range entanglement not accessible using nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates. Our tangled-schedule method provides a new tool for building quantum error-correction circuits and we explore applications to design new architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Notably, we show that, for the widely used Pauli-based model of computation (achieved by lattice surgery), this access to longer-range entanglement can reduce the device connectivity requirements, without compromising on circuit depth.},

abstract = {Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum systems, generative quantum machine learning (QML) offers the potential to outperform classical learning models. Current generative QML algorithms mostly rely on general-purpose models that, while being very expressive, face several training challenges. A potential way to address these setbacks involves constructing problem-informed models capable of more efficient training on structured problems. In particular, probabilistic graphical models provide a flexible framework for representing structure in generative learning problems and can thus be exploited to incorporate inductive bias in QML algorithms. In this work, we propose a problem-informed quantum circuit Born machine Ansatz for learning the joint probability distribution of random variables, with independence relations efficiently represented by a Markov network (MN). We further demonstrate the applicability of the MN framework in constructing generative learning benchmarks and compare our model's performance to previous designs, showing it outperforms problem-agnostic circuits. Based on a preliminary analysis of trainability, we narrow down the class of MNs to those exhibiting favorable trainability properties. Finally, we discuss the potential of our model to offer quantum advantage in the context of generative learning.},

abstract = {Generalized measurements, also called positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), can offer advantages over projective measurements in various quantum information tasks. Here, we realize a generalized measurement of one and two superconducting qubits with high fidelity and in a single experimental setting. To do so, we propose a hybrid method, the "Naimark-terminated binary tree," based on a hybridization of Naimark's dilation and binary tree techniques that leverages emerging hardware capabilities for mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward control. Furthermore, we showcase a highly effective use of approximate compiling to enhance POVM fidelity in noisy conditions. We argue that our hybrid method scales better toward larger system sizes than its constituent methods and demonstrate its advantage by performing detector tomography of symmetric, informationally complete POVM (SIC-POVM). Detector fidelity is further improved through a composite error mitigation strategy that incorporates twirling and a newly devised conditional readout error mitigation. Looking forward, we expect improvements in approximate compilation and hardware noise for dynamic circuits to enable generalized measurements of larger multi-qubit POVMs on superconducting qubits.},

We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with rate-limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.},

abstract = {In this work, we highlight an unforeseen behavior of the expressivity of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) for machine learning. A large class of these models, seen as Fourier Series which frequencies are derived from the encoding gates, were thought to have their Fourier coefficients mostly determined by the trainable gates. Here, we demonstrate a new correlation between the Fourier coefficients of the quantum model and its encoding gates. In addition, we display a phenomenon of vanishing expressivity in certain settings, where some Fourier coefficients vanish exponentially when the number of qubits grows. These two behaviors imply novel forms of constraints which limit the expressivity of PQCs, and therefore imply a new inductive bias for Quantum models. The key concept in this work is the notion of a frequency redundancy in the Fourier series spectrum, which determines its importance. Those theoretical behaviours are observed in numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Large-scale variational quantum algorithms are widely recognized as a potential pathway to achieve practical quantum advantages. However, the presence of quantum noise might suppress and undermine these advantages, which blurs the boundaries of classical simulability. To gain further clarity on this matter, we present a novel polynomial-scale method based on the path integral of observable's back-propagation on Pauli paths (OBPPP). This method efficiently approximates quantum mean values in variational quantum algorithms with bounded truncation error in the presence of independent single-qubit depolarizing noise. Theoretically, we rigorously prove: 1) For a fixed noise rate λ, OBPPP's time and space complexity exhibit a polynomial relationship with the number of qubits $n$, the circuit depth $L$, the inverse truncation error $frac1ε$, and the root square inverse success probability $frac1sqrtdelta$. 2) For variable λ, the computational complexity becomes $mathrmPolyłeft(n,Lright)$ when λ exceeds $frac1łogL$ and it becomes exponential with $L$ when λ falls below $frac1L$. Numerically, we conduct classical simulations of IBM's zero-noise extrapolated experimental results on the 127-qubit Eagle processor [Nature textbf618, 500 (2023)]. Our method attains higher accuracy and faster runtime compared to the quantum device. Moreover, this approach enables us to deduce noisy outcomes from noiseless results, allowing us to accurately reproduce IBM's unmitigated results that directly correspond to raw experimental observations.},

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for optimal and robust quantum state tomography for systems with constrained controllability. Based on the specific symmetry, we decompose the Hilbert space to alleviate the complexity of tomography and design a compact strategy with the minimum number of measurements. To switch between these measurement settings, we adopted parameterized quantum circuits consisting of local operations and free evolution, which are easy to implement in most practical systems. Then the parameters of these circuits were optimized to improve the robustness against random errors of measurements. Furthermore, we apply this method to a 10-spin star-topology register and demonstrate its ability to characterize large-scale systems. Our results can help future investigations of quantum systems with constrained ability of quantum control and measurement},

abstract = {In this work we find a protocol which allows the parties to distill a certain amount of Bell pairs with a fixed asymptotic error strictly smaller than one from any unknown distillable state, using only LOCC operations. Moreover, we link two seemingly unrelated concepts: the existence of a universal distillation algorithm and the strong converse distillable entanglement. To do so we conceive the following protocol: Alice and Bob decide to use a fraction of their n copies of their shared state to obtain a classical estimate, then Alice sends her part of the state to Bob via classical teleportation, after that Bob is able to perform a measure such that the infidelity between the estimate and the actual state scales as O(1/n). After this passage Alice and Bob perform on the remaining copies the optimal LOCC to distill entanglement from the estimate, thanks to the scaling of the infidelity they can achieve the optimal rate on this batch of copies paying the price of an error which depends on the fraction of the copies used to obtain the classical estimate.},

abstract = {This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics – the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than r^-2 and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by e^const.β, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.},

abstract = {Quantum computers have a great potential to provide a computational advantage in solving difficult problems that classical computers cannot effectively solve. The reason why quantum computers seem to be faster than their classical counterparts is not fully understood. Some works have suggested that 
entanglement and coherence could be the reason for the quantum speed-up. But certain results, such as the Gottesmann-Knill theorem, suggest that the answer is more complicated. Recent studies point to contextuality. 
In this work, we address the following question: how much of the different quantum resources can a particular device produce? By answering this question, we can understand its capabilities and better tailor its use to solve specific problems. 
In this context, we study the resources produced by quantum random circuits using different sets of elementary gates. For this goal we use different quantifiers. We start with the degree of violation of the Svetlichny inequalities to quantify non-locality, we also use different entanglement measures such 
as Tangle, Concurrency, Von Neumann Entropy, Negativity, etc. We first perform a theoretical 
study based on numerical simulations using Qiskit and the Amazon Braket SDK, compare our theoretical results with experimental data from real quantum processors, and provide a quantitative evaluation of 
their capabilities. 
Our study contributes to the ongoing debate on the quantum advantage, the certification of quantum devices and shows that entanglement and non-locality are indeed important resources that can be exploited by quantum random circuits. We also show that it is possible to compare them between different devices and that entanglement disappears as the noise in the circuit increases.},

abstract = {The polynomial hierarchy (PH) has played a central role in complexity theory for the last 50 years. Given its significance, it is only natural to explore quantum generalizations, yet such generalizations remain embarrassingly not understood. 
This work studies several quantum generalizations of the quantifier-based definition of PH. The setup for these hierarchies is the same as for PH, except the verifier can perform quantum computations and the provers send different types of proofs (e.g., entangled quantum states, unentangled pure states). So, for example, QCPH is just like PH, except the verifier can perform quantum computation. 
We establish the following results: 
- (A collapse theorem for QCPH.) For any k ≥ 1, if the k-th levels of QCPH are equal, then QCPH collapses to its k-th level. 
- (Quantum-classical Karp-Lipton theorem.) If QCMA ⊆ BQP/mpoly, then QCPH collapses to its second level. That is, QCMA does not have poly-size quantum circuits unless QCPH collapses. 
- (QEPH collapses.) We introduce the entangled quantum polynomial hierarchy QEPH. We prove that QEPH collapses to its second level and equals QRG(1), the class of problems having one-turn quantum-refereed games. 
- (Error reduction for pureQPH and QEPH). We prove one-sided error reduction for pureQPH, which uses a new asymmetric version of the Harrow-Montanaro Product Test. We also show that error reduction is possible for QEPH. 
- (Relationship between hierarchies.) We prove that PH ⊆ QCPH ⊆ QPH ⊆ pureQPH ⊆ EXP^PP, and QEPH ⊆ QPH. Previously, it was not known if even PH ⊆ QPH, and the best upper bound on QPH was the exponential time hierarchy. - (Distribution hierarchies.) We introduce generalizations of PH and QCPH, where the provers send distributions over strings (instead of strings), we denote these by DistributionPH and DistributionQCPH. We prove that DistributionPH = PH and DistributionQCPH = QCPH by generalizing a game-theoretic result of Lipton and Young (1994).},

In this work, we develop a distance-preserving flag FTEC protocol for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which requires only two ancilla qubits per generator and can be implemented on a planar layout. We generalize the weight-parity error correction (WPEC) technique from [1] and find a gate ordering of flag circuits for the concatenated Steane code which makes syndrome extraction with two ancilla qubits per generator possible. The FTEC protocol is constructed using the optimization tools for flag FTEC developed in [2] and is simulated under the circuit-level noise model without idling noise. Our simulations give a pseudothreshold of 1.64×10^−3 for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which is better than a pseudothreshold of 1.43×10^−3 for the [[61,1,9]] 6.6.6 color code simulated under the same settings. This is in contrast to the code capacity model where the [[61,1,9]] code performs better.

The key bottleneck for this computation is the summation of infinitely many tensor diagrams. The way we solve this problem is to represent the tensor diagram summations as a suitably defined generating function [1] for PEPS, as demonstrated in Figure 1. This is possible due to locality of many-body systems and the fact that low-energy excitations only contain one or few quasiparticles. Taking a physically motivated form for excited states, we show that relevant objects in determining excitations can be expressed as derivatives of a single tensor diagram and thus can be efficiently computed [2]. With excited states available, dynamical correlations can also be conveniently computed. We hope that, through the adoption of tensor network generating functions, many physical properties can be more easily obtained with the tensor network algorithm.

We extend our methods for any number of target qubits, and provide further cost reductions if additional ancilla qubits are available. For each type of multi-controlled gate, we provide implementations for unrestricted (all-to-all) connectivity and for linear-nearest-neighbor. All of the methods use a linear cost of gates from the Clifford+T (fault-tolerant) set. In the context of linear-nearest-neighbor architecture, the cost and depth of our circuits scale linearly irrespective of the position of the qubits on which the gate is applied. Our methods directly improve the compilation process of many quantum algorithms, providing optimized circuits, which will result in a large reduction of errors.},

abstract = {In order to assess the information content of a statistical experiment (a collection of classical or quantum states), we need to compare it to other experiments. This comparability is called majorization and, in the classical case, we arrive at matrix majorization and, in the quantum case, at quantum majorization between tuples of quantum states. We study comparison of statistical experiments aided by having many copies of the experiments (large-sample case) or having an extra experiment aiding the majorization (catalytic case). We give explicit sufficient and almost necessary conditions for matrix majorization in large samples using multi-party extensions of the Renyi divergences. We also see that varying support restrictions yield varying sets of these multi-party divergences relevant for majorization in large samples. As a direct quantum application, we are finally able to give a secure proof for the sufficient and necessary conditions for asymptotic thermal majorization between quantum states of a thermodynamic system. Full quantum majorization between quantum statistical experiments is still a daunting problem, but we find sufficient and almost necessary conditions for measurement majorization. This means that we can give conditions characterizing when a given pair of quantum states yield given classical outcomes in some POVM measurement in large enough samples. More general quantum majorization results require the study of multi-party quantum divergences. Thus, defining such divergences and investigating their properties remains as a very important agenda.},

This range of parameter is tight. Our work resolves a conjecture by Ji, Liu and Song. 
Since subset states of small size have small entanglement across all cuts, this construction also illustrates a pseudoentanglement phenomenon.

abstract = {Finding solid and practical quantum advantages via noisy quantum devices without error correction is a critical but challenging problem. Conversely, comprehending the fundamental limitations of the state-of-the-art is equally crucial. In this work, we observe the polynomial-time indistinguishability of n-qubit devices from random coins when circuit depths exceed omega(log(n)) under single-qubit depolarizing noise. Even with classical processing, we can demonstrate the absence of computational advantage in polynomial-time algorithms with noisy quantum circuits of super-logarithmic depths. This finding decisively negates the feasibility of executing prominent quantum algorithms such as Shor's, Grover's, and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm. In addition, our results apply to variational quantum algorithms, error mitigation, and quantum simulation with polynomial depths. Furthermore, we consider noisy quantum devices with restraint gate topology. We rule out super-polynomial quantum advantages for a one-dimensional noisy qubit array in all-depth regimes. We also establish upper limits on entanglement generation: O(log(n)) for one-dimensional arrays and O(sqrt(n) log(n)) for two-dimensional arrays. Our findings underscore the entanglement scalability constraints in noisy quantum devices.},

abstract = {Although theoretical and experimental research on quantum computers focuses mainly on qubit systems, research on higher-dimensional systems (qudits) on near-term quantum devices seems promising. Some problems are coded more efficiently in qudits systems. An example is the Graph n-Colouring problem, an NP-hard problem with practical applications, the goal is to use n colours to colour the nodes of a graph such that the nodes sharing an edge have different colours. It can be solved using the qubit-based QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm). If the number of colours is not a power of 2, some states must be penalized introducing a penalty Hamiltonian and so increasing the depth circuit. In this work we explore the possibility of solving the Graph 9-Coloring problem running a noiseless simulation of a qutrit-based QAOA. The resources and the quality of the solutions are compared with the qubit-based QAOA ones. Preliminary results show that the qutrit-based QAOA circuit uses less resources, such as circuit depth and number of gates, than the qubit-based counterpart.},

abstract = {The computational capabilities of near-term quantum computers are limited by the noisy execution of gate operations and a limited number of physical qubits. Hybrid variational algorithms are well-suited to near-term quantum devices because they allow for a wide range of tradeoffs between the amount of quantum and classical resources used to solve a problem. This paper investigates tradeoffs available at both the algorithmic and hardware levels by studying a specific case – applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to instances of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. We consider three variants of the QAOA which offer different tradeoffs at the algorithmic level in terms of their required number of classical parameters, quantum gates, and iterations of classical optimization needed. Since MIS is a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the QAOA must respect the problem constraints. This can be accomplished by using many multi-controlled gate operations which must be decomposed into gates executable by the target hardware. We study the tradeoffs available at this hardware level, combining the gate fidelities and decomposition efficiencies of different native gate sets into a single metric called the gate decomposition cost.},

Minimal models saturating the memory constraints imposed by physics represent the 'Occam’s Razor’ for observed behavior, quantifying the minimal causal mechanisms needed for their explanation. We extend these concepts to the quantum regime. Leveraging a novel quantum model reduction principle which we call linear dependence of future morphs, we derive the q-transducer, which we prove to be the memory minimal quantum model of a quantum process. We show that an experimenter interacting with a quantum process can asymptotically obtain maximal predictive ability by learning the current state of the q-transducer. We devise a model reduction algorithm to find q-transducers, and argue for the potential of efficient implementation.},

The fact that the model Hamiltonian may contain non-commuting terms can make QBM more expressive than the classical Boltzmann machine, and in stark contrast to many other quantum machine learning models, training the QBM with an appropriate choice of objective function does not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. In this work we numerically investigate the performance of QBMs for different target Gibbs states, model Hamiltonians, training parameters, and training strategies, used as a quantum generative model. We have developed a software package [1] that performs the QBM training with various combinations of target, model, and parameters using exact diagonalization on classical computers.

Quantum state tomography and Hamiltonian learning are essential for interpreting and optimizing quantum systems, yet a unified approach remains elusive. Such an integration could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between quantum states and Hamiltonians, contributing to the development of more efficient methodologies. In this paper, we present a method that integrates quantum state tomography and Hamiltonian learning, drawing inspiration from machine translation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a variety of quantum systems, successfully learning the complex relationships between quantum states and Hamiltonians. Furthermore, the scalability and few-shot learning capabilities of our method could potentially minimize the resources required for characterizing and optimizing quantum systems.

abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises everlasting security based on the laws of physics. Most common protocols are grouped into two distinct categories based on the degrees of freedom used to carry information, which can be either discrete or continuous, each presenting unique advantages in either performance, feasibility for near-term implementation, and compatibility with existing telecommunications architectures. Recently, hybrid QKD protocols have been introduced to leverage advantages from both categories. In this work we provide a rigorous security proof for a protocol introduced by Qi in 2021, where information is encoded in discrete variables as in the widespread Bennett Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol but decoded continuously via heterodyne detection. Security proofs for hybrid protocols inherit the same challenges associated with continuous-variable protocols due to unbounded dimensions. Here we successfully address these challenges by exploiting symmetry. Our approach enables truncation of the Hilbert space with precise control of the approximation errors and lead to a tight, semi-analytical expression for the asymptotic key rate under collective attacks. As concrete examples, we apply our theory to compute the key rates under passive attacks, linear loss, and Gaussian noise.},

abstract = {Quantum coherence is one of the fundamental aspects distinguishing classical and quantum theories. Coherence between different energy eigenstates is particularly important, as it serves as a valuable resource under the law of energy conservation. A fundamental question in this setting is how well one can prepare good coherent states from low coherent states and whether a given coherent state is convertible to another one. Here, we show that any low coherent state is convertible to any high coherent state arbitrarily well in two operational settings: asymptotic and catalytic transformations. For a variant of asymptotic coherence manipulation where one aims to prepare desired states in local subsystems, the rate of transformation becomes unbounded regardless of how weak the initial coherence is. In a non-asymptotic transformation with a catalyst, a helper state that locally remains in the original form after the transformation, we show that an arbitrary state can be obtained from any low coherent state. Applying this to the standard asymptotic setting, we find that a catalyst can increase the coherence distillation rate significantly—from zero to infinite rate. We also prove that such anomalous transformation requires small but non-zero coherence in relevant modes, establishing the condition under which a sharp transition of the operational capability occurs. Our results provide a general characterization of the coherence transformability in these operational settings and showcase their peculiar properties compared to other common resource theories such as entanglement and quantum thermodynamics.},

Specifically in finance, multivariate state preparation is required for multivariate Monte Carlo simulation, which is used for important numerical tasks. Using the existing method, multivariate quantum state preparation requires the number of gates exponential in the number of variables. For this task, we propose a quantum algorithm that only requires the number of gates linear in the number of variables. Our algorithm utilizes multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP), a technique to perform the multivariate polynomial transformation of the amplitude. Using easily prepared block-encodings corresponding to each variable, we apply the M-QSP in the subspace to construct the target function. In this way, our algorithm prepares the target state efficiently for functions achievable with M-QSP.},

A learner has sequential oracle access to an unknown pure quantum state, and in each round selects a pure probe state. Regret is incurred if the unknown state is measured orthogonal to this probe, and the learner's goal is to minimise the expected cumulative regret over $T$ rounds. The challenge is to find the balance between most informative and measurements incurring minimal regret. We show that the cumulative regret scales as $Theta(polylog T)$ using a new sample-optimal tomography algorithm based on a median of means online least squares estimator.},

This paper looks at the post-quantum security and privacy of digital tokens, with particular emphasis on how quantum tokens can be implemented. Quantum token leverages quantum states for information storage. Traditional proposals often unrealistically assume personal quantum computing access for each user. To overcome this, we introduce a novel cloud-based quantum token protocol, employing a two-layer quantum homomorphic encryption method. This enables classical entities to securely outsource quantum computations to third-party quantum cloud services via classical communication channels. Our approach significantly reduces the quantum resource demands on users and facilitates seamless integration with current classical systems. We present a simulation of our experiment and a quantitative analysis of the cloud's quantum resource needs. Our work offers a strategic blueprint for organizations to adopt a quantum version of digital tokens within their classical frameworks with enhanced security and functionality.},

author = {Benoît Dubus and Jérémie Roland},
year  = {2024},
date = {2024-01-01},
abstract = {Many applications in quantum computing, quantum physics and quantum chemistry need to evaluate the evolution of a quantum system under a weighted sum of several Hamiltonians. Such evolution can be simulated on quantum computer by breaking down the unitary into a succession of unitary gates, typically evaluating each Hamiltonian during a small-time step according to a particular compilation scheme. In this context we can distinguish deterministic schemes and those relying on random processes that we will call random compilers. 
The best-known random compilers (such as the randomized nth order Trotter and qDrift [1, 2]) rely on an analysis based on the Trotter Formula and Suzuki-like integrators [3]. Theses mathematical tools are quite heavy and therefore hard to use practically. We develop a new mathematical approach to the same problem. The process is mainly viewed as a succession of gates representing the evolution of the system for small-time steps (either of fixed or random duration). We consider alternatively a continuous-time model, with a classical system controlling the quantum system. If the classical system is in a state i, then the corresponding Hamiltonian is applied onto the quantum system. Each transition from a state i onto a state j is governed by a Poisson process with a specific rate, and therefore the classical control is defined as a Markov chain. This helps us derive new differential equations on the evolution of the density matrix representing the average state over all realization of the whole system (the tensor product of the quantum and classical part) as a Lindbladian equation. 
These equations are simple and allow us to establish complexity (expressed in the number of gates) that are comparable to the state of the art [1, 2], while making less and arguably cleaner calculation. We derive a minimal number of gate for a sum of a given number of Hamiltonians of bounded magnitude during a certain time with a bounded error. 
This technique also has the advantage to explicitly include the classical control of the model, which could lead to further applications by considering more complicated schemes, for instance, considering that the transition rates can be time-depending and on the current state. 
Potential applications include the simulation and study of adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) algorithms [4] and (randomized versions of) QAOA Algorithm [5]). This technique can be further extended to other schemes via the introduction of discrete CPPT transformation of the quantum state at each transition, or post-selection, and therefore it could lead to efficiently produce complexity results for more complex schemes.

abstract = {Lattice gauge theories constitute an important tool in studying the fundamental interactions of matter within particle physics and have a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory. While classical numerical methods can be used to simulate many properties of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories efficiently, the intrinsic quantum nature of these theories makes other relevant physical phenomena hard to reproduce. Quantum simulators offer a promising approach to address these challenges, with successful simulations of Abelian theories in different quantum platforms demonstrating their potential in the last decades. Despite these advances, quantum simulation of non-Abelian theories remains challenging. Recent research efforts aimed at the analog simulation of these gauge theories have predominantly focused on atomic quantum platforms like ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here, we propose a minimal model for a (2+1)-dimensional pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory, implementable as an analog simulation on superconducting quantum hardware. We study properties of the system, such as the effect of adding bosonic excitations, and explore its experimental implementation. Our work contributes to the exploration and understanding of non-Abelian gauge theories and offers a new and rich implementation to study lattice gauge theories using superconducting qubits.},

A key feature distinguishing entanglement from classical correlations is the occurrence of correlations for complementary measurement bases. In particular, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a paradigmatic example that is well-understood and routinely employed for entanglement certification. However, implementing unbiased measurements exactly is challenging and not generically possible for all physical platforms. Here, we extend the entanglement-certification toolbox from correlations in MUBs to arbitrary bases, even without requiring aligned reference frames. This represents a practically significant simplification that paves the way for the efficient characterization of high-dimensional entanglement in a wide range of physical systems.},

However, the non-Markovian counterpart is much more complicated due to the memory effect of the environment. We ask whether an advantage gap exists between free-evolving and controlled non-Markovian processes in the context of quantum parameter estimation. We analyze a certain case where the system is subjected to a strong coupling environment. The desired parameter to be estimated is the system frequency. The whole experiment suffers from an unknown time uncertainty due to a bad clock. The experimenter can choose to estimate the system frequency with the free-evolving process or with the controlled process. We show that the latter has a better precision scaling than the former. This demonstrates that quantum control can improve quantum parameter estimation and increase robustness to certain hardware defects. Our work provides a new perspective on quantum parameter estimation with limited resources and may also shed light on the study of non-Markovian processes.},

abstract = {We study the sample complexity of the classical shadows task: what is the fewest number of 
copies of an unknown state you need to measure to predict expected values with respect to some 
class of observables? Large joint measurements are likely required in order to minimize sample 
complexity, but previous joint measurement protocols only work when the unknown state is pure. 
We present the first joint measurement protocol for classical shadows whose sample complexity 
scales with the rank of the unknown state. In particular we prove O( sqrt(rB) / eps^2 ) samples suffice, 
where r is the rank of the state, B is a bound on the squared Frobenius norm of the observables, 
and eps is the target accuracy. In the low-rank regime, this is a nearly quadratic advantage over 
traditional approaches that use single-copy measurements. 
We present several intermediate results that may be of independent interest: a solution to 
a new formulation of classical shadows that captures functions of non-identical input states; a 
generalization of a “nice” Schur basis used for optimal qubit purification and quantum majority 
vote; and a measurement strategy that allows us to use local symmetries in the Schur basis to avoid intractable Weingarten calculations in the analysis.},

abstract = {Decoherence remains a major challenge for quantum technologies. Several important strategies, such as decoherence-free spaces, clock transitions, dynamical decoupling, and composite pulses, reduce the effect of noise, lowering decoherence and control error rates. Each strategy takes advantage of a certain “resource” to protect quantum 
information. 
In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protection strategy that leverages a new kind of resource – the cross-correlation of two noise sources, e.g. control fields. Such cross-correlations exist when the control fields are generated from the same source or pass through the same transmission line. As an example, we modify the continuous concatenated dynamical decoupling control scheme. As we show, introducing a frequency shift to one of the control fields, which is proportional to the degree of cross-correlation, results in destructive interference of the cross- correlated noise. Our scheme results in a tenfold increase in the coherence time of a single NV center in diamond, and outperforms the widely used XY8 sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the magnetometry of GHz signals with record sensitivity and robust qubit 
operations. In light of recent characterizations of noise cross-correlations in quantum systems, our contribution opens a new avenue in the field of noise protection for quantum technologies.},

abstract = {The exponential convergence to invariant subspaces of quantum Markov semigroups plays a crucial role in quantum information theory. One such example is in bosonic error correction schemes, where dissipation is used to drive states back to the code-space - an invariant subspace protected against certain types of errors. In this paper, we investigate perturbations of quantum dynamical semigroups that operate on continuous variable (CV) systems and admit an invariant subspace. First, we prove a generation theorem for quantum Markov semigroups on CV systems under the physical assumptions that (i) the generator has GKSL form with corresponding jump operators defined as polynomials of annihilation and creation operators; and (ii) the (possibly unbounded) generator increases all moments in a controlled manner. Additionally, we show that the level sets of operators with bounded first moments are admissible subspaces of the evolution, providing the foundations for a perturbative analysis. Our results also extend to time-dependent semigroups. We apply our general framework to two settings of interest in continuous variables quantum information processing. First, we provide a new scheme for deriving continuity bounds on the energy-constrained capacities of Markovian perturbations of Quantum dynamical semigroups. Second, we provide quantitative perturbation bounds for the steady state of the quantum Ornstein Uhlenbeck semigroup and the invariant subspace of the photon dissipation used in bosonic error correction.},

DDTQW has two regimes based on the interference between the walker number, i.e., phase matched and phase mismatched. We derive an expression for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the phase-matched regime of DDTQW driven using the squeezing operator, demonstrating an exponential increase in QFI. In the phase-mismatched regime, QFI varies as 𝑡^2, consistent with previous studies. Our analysis shows that parameter estimation can be improved by driving the walk using squeezing operators.},

counterfeiting. However, Wiesner’s pioneering scheme not only lacks security but it is also private-key in nature, 
i.e. , it requires the bank as an intermediary to authenticate transactions. Aaronson and Christiano first proposed 
a formal mathematical structure of public-key quantum money and proved that there exists a unitary blackbox 
oracle relative to which a public-key quantum money scheme exists. However, they failed to provide an explicit 
construction for such an oracle and prove its security under standard cryptographic assumptions. Among notable 
works that followed after, Zhandry proposed ""Quantum Lightning"" based schemes but they were neither an explict 
construction nor were they secure, as their security is known to be broken now. To date, there is no known explicit 
public-key quantum money scheme with provable security under standard cryptographic assumptions. Recently, a 
new cryptographic primitive called Quantum Physical Unclonable Fucntion (QPUF) was defined under standard 
cryptographic assumptions. Motivated by this, we show how unitary QPUFs can be used to obtain an explicit 
public-key quantum money scheme and prove its security under standard cryptographic assumptions. Finally, we 
contend that although we present our models under the ideal assumption of having QPUFs as a perfect source of 
randomness, our models offer a systematic road-map to obtain more realistic schemes which we leave for future work.},

As a main result, we numerically demonstrate that our protocol can verify several classes of $N(łeq 5)$-qubit pure states, including randomly sampled pure states with $cN$ number of samples with a constant $c$. In contrast, the best-known verification protocol using single-qubit Pauli measurements that can verify an arbitrary entangled state, called the direct fidelity estimation, requires $O(2^N)$ number of samples. Our results not only support a very recent result proven by Huang et al. but also suggest that their verification protocol could be improved in terms of sample complexity.},

We explicitly prove how to update our formalism with Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates, and measurements, enabling universal circuit simulation. We also discuss how the framework allows for efficient simulation of more states, raising some interesting questions on the representation power of tensor networks and the quantum properties of resources such as entanglement and magic, and support our claims with simulations.},

abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a near-term quantum algorithm designed to estimate the groundstate energy of a molecular system. Unfortunately to achieve accurate results VQE requires a prohibitive number of shots, thus far restricting its utility to very small systems. Classical shadows tomography (CST) is a partial tomography scheme that can predict many properties of a quantum system given relatively few measurements. It has been suggested as a solution to the measurement problem in VQE and comes with the additional benefit of "measure now, ask questions later". That is, because CST doesn't need to know a priori which observables we are wanting to estimate, the same measurement results can be recycled to predict arbitrary expectation values. In this work, we develop a biasing scheme for Clifford-measurement CST that can be used to improve the accuracy of expectation value estimations for observables known a priori (such as the groundstate energy) while not sacrificing the ability to predict arbitrary expectation values, something that is lost in biased Pauli-measurement CST schemes. We demonstrate the method by simultaneously measuring the groundstate energy and arbitrary Pauli strings for a range of molecular systems. This work successfully improves Clifford-measurement CST for use within VQE while staying faithful to the core principle of CST.},

abstract = {We analyze the performance of a quantum error correction code subject to physically motivated noise modeled by a Lindblad master equation. Working within the code-capacity framework, we consider a noise model including dissipative and coherent single-qubit terms and two-qubit crosstalk, studying how well different approximations of the noise capture the performance of the five-qubit code. We find that a composite-channel approximation where every noise term is considered separately, can capture the behavior in many physical cases up to relatively long timescales. Single-qubit approximations do not manage to properly capture the error correction dynamics with two-qubit noise, even for short times. A Pauli approximation going beyond a single-qubit channel, works well in many cases at short timescales relative to the noise strength, after which it eventually fails. We calculate the code pseudo-threshold emerging within this approach, and demonstrate how knowledge of the qubit parameters and connectivity can be used to design better decoders. These results shed light on the performance of error correction codes in the presence of realistic noise and can advance the ongoing efforts toward useful quantum error correction.},

abstract = {We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radia- tion in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic quantum Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver.},

This advantage is evidenced by the quadratic scaling of the single-parameter quantum Fisher information for corresponding rotation angles, highlighting the potential for improved precision in estimation of non-commuting rotations.

abstract = {Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small-to-medium size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We provide both a fully explicit description of Hastings's method and propose a substantially simplified weight reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph and lifted product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor, but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes in a photonic quantum computing architecture based on GKP qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight reduction method substantially improves code performance.},

In the usual paradigm of Bell nonlocality, there are certain states which exhibit nonlocality only after the application of suitable local filtering operations, which, in turn, are some special stochastic local operations assisted with classical communication (SLOCC). In the present work, we introduce the notion of hidden non n-locality. The notion is detailed using a bilocal network. We provide instances of hidden nonbilocality and nontrilocality, where we notice quite intriguingly that nonbilocality is observed even when one of the sources distributes a mixed two-qubit separable state. Furthermore, a characterization of hidden nonbilocality is also provided in terms of the Bloch-Fano decomposition, wherein we conjecture that, to witness hidden nonbilocality, one of the two states (used by the sources) must have nonnull local Bloch vectors. Noise is inevitable in practical scenarios, which makes it imperative to study any possible method to enhance the possibility of detecting nonclassicality in the presence of noise in the network. We find that local filtering enhances the robustness to noise, which we demonstrate using bit-flip and amplitude-damping channels.},

Even for a Bell inequality that has a certain symmetry, there is no guarantee that its maximal quantum violation can be achieved by employing a symmetrical strategy that is also minimal in dimension.

abstract = {A critical and unresolved problem in information science is: What are the precise limits of quantum communication? Dr. T. Kuwahara and I are curious whether this challenge can be solved through the powerful techniques of operator spreading. In 1972, the concept of the Lieb-Robinson bound was proposed, defining the maximum propagation of any information inside quantum many-body systems. This principle, intimately linked to the spreading of operators, finds extensive application in areas such as quantum simulation and information scrambling. On the other hand, the Holevo capacity characterizes the maximum amount of classical information that can be transferred through a quantum channel. In this poster, Dr. T. Kuwahara and I first established the general connection between the Holevo capacity and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We first provided the rigorous conditions under which operator spreading is equivalent to information propagation. We then provided two generalized theorems for the limits of quantum communication as long as unitary time evolution is satisfied. Theorem one universally gives strict upper and lower bounds on the amount of classical information over a quantum channel. Theorem two generalized shows rigorous upper and lower bounds on the entanglement capacity, which is the quantum information theoretic counterpart of heat capacity. Moving forward, we intend to extend our findings to open systems and explore the complexity of quantum dissipative dynamics from an information-theoretic lens.},

abstract = {Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a key quantum algorithm, which has been widely studied as a method to perform chemistry and solid-state calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Recently, several authors have proposed statistical alternatives to QPE that have benefits on early fault-tolerant devices, including shorter circuits and better suitability for error-mitigation techniques. Here, we will describe an implementation of statistical phase estimation on Rigetti’s superconducting processors. Specifically, we use a modification of the Lin and Tong [PRX Quantum 3, 010318 (2022)] algorithm with the improved Fourier approximation of Wan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 030503 (2022)]. We then incorporate error mitigation strategies including zero-noise extrapolation. We discuss a new method to estimate energies from statistical phase estimation data, which is found to improve the accuracy in the final energy estimates by 1–2 orders of magnitude, compared to previous approaches based on eigenvalue thresholding. We apply these methods to chemistry problems for active spaces up to four electrons in four orbitals, and correctly estimate energies within chemical precision. We also find that statistical phase estimation has a natural resilience to noise, particularly after mitigating coherent errors, and can achieve far higher accuracy than suggested by previous analysis. We will discuss the implication of these results for applications of statistical QPE in the early fault-tolerant era.},

abstract = {A fundamental concept in quantum information is the computation of the moments of the distribution of expectation values. These moments describe the distribution obtained by sending a quantum state through a random unitary transformation (a circuit), sampled from some distribution, and then measuring a specific observable. While calculating these moments exactly is typically challenging, if the unitary transformation consists of local random gates, one can estimate these moments using Monte Carlo simulations of a process similar to a Markov chain. However, this method may require an impractically large number of samples or may suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to estimate the moments using tensor networks. In this method, the operators corresponding to the moments of the local gates are represented as small dimensional tensors acting on their local commutant bases. By utilizing representation theoretical tools, we analyze the local tensor dimensions and provide bounds for the bond dimension of the matrix product states that arise from deep circuits. We compare our techniques against Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms them. Additionally, we illustrate how tensor networks can precisely compute the second moment when the unitary transformation is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and containing thousands of gates. Finally, we numerically study the anticoncentration phenomena in circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task that cannot be effectively studied using Monte Carlo methods due to sign problems.},

abstract = {Sampling from the output of quantum circuits is known to be a hard task for a classical computer in general. This hardness even holds for shallow circuits, for which computing local expectation values can be done efficiently by a light cone argument. For many optimization problems, local expectation values are sufficient to determine the expectation cost function. However, obtaining an actual solution to the problem (e.g., a coloring) is the main goal of combinatorial optimization. The objective of this work is to introduce an end-to-end framework to approximate the output of quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems using available quantum (noisy) and classical resources. Our work proposes a novel approach for sampling from quantum circuits made for combinatorial optimization and provides a pathway for using expectation values to obtain samples from quantum circuits through randomized rounding. Our method is simple and performs well under noisy conditions, as we are able to sample from the noisy quantum circuit at fixed depth for certain optimization problems. We also do not require the depth or noise to be greater than a specific threshold, making it a versatile and robust approach for various scenarios. We also provide an efficient classical algorithm to compute expectation values of local observables under non-unital noise, extending previous works to more general noise models. Combined with our sampling algorithm this offers us a powerful end-to-end method for sampling from noisy quantum circuits.},

abstract = {We demonstrate quantum advantage with several basic assumptions, specifically based on only the existence of OWFs. We introduce inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ), and construct it from classical bit commitments. IV-PoQ is an interactive protocol between a verifier and a quantum prover consisting of two phases. In the first phase, the verifier is probabilistic polynomial-time, and it interacts with the prover. In the second phase, the verifier becomes inefficient, and makes its decision based on the transcript of the first phase. If the prover is honest, the inefficient verifier accepts with high probability, but any classical malicious prover only has a small probability of being accepted by the inefficient verifier. Our construction demonstrates the following results: (1)If one-way functions exist, then IV-PoQ exist. (2)If distributional collision-resistant hash functions exist (which exist if hard-on-average problems in SZK exist), then constant-round IV-PoQ exist. We also demonstrate quantum advantage based on worst-case-hard assumptions. We define auxiliary-input IV-PoQ (AI-IV-PoQ) that only require that for any malicious prover, there exist infinitely many auxiliary inputs under which the prover cannot cheat. We construct AI-IV-PoQ from an auxiliary-input version of commitments in a similar way, showing that (1)If auxiliary-input one-way functions exist (which exist if CZK⊈BPP), then AI-IV-PoQ exist. (2)If auxiliary-input collision-resistant hash functions exist (which is equivalent to PWPP⊈FBPP) or SZK⊈BPP, then constant-round AI-IV-PoQ exist.},

We propose a simple method for routing and wavelength assignment in wavelength multiplexed networks in which classical and quantum channels coexist. The proposed heuristics take into account the specific requirements of quantum key distribution and focus on keeping at bay the contamination of the quantum channels by photons coming from the classical signals by non-linear processes, among others. These heuristics reduce the shared path between classical and quantum channels and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the quantum channels, improving their quantum key rate. We compare the results to the usual classical RWA approach.},

abstract = {We study the complexity of a classic problem in computational topology, the homology problem: given a description of some space X and an integer k, decide if X contains a k-dimensional hole. The setting and statement of the homology problem are completely classical, yet we find that the complexity is characterized by quantum complexity classes. Our result can be seen as an aspect of a connection between homology and supersymmetric quantum mechanics [Wit82]. We consider clique complexes, motivated by the practical application of topological data analysis (TDA). The clique complex of a graph is the simplicial complex formed by declaring every k+1-clique in the graph to be a k-simplex. Our main result is that deciding whether the clique complex of a weighted graph has a hole or not, given a suitable promise on the gap, is QMA1-hard and contained in QMA. Our main innovation is a technique to lower bound the eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian operator. For this, we invoke a tool from algebraic topology known as spectral sequences. In particular, we exploit a connection between spectral sequences and Hodge theory [For94]. Spectral sequences will play a role analogous to perturbation theory for combinatorial Laplacians. In addition, we develop the simplicial surgery technique used in prior work [CK22]. Our result provides some suggestion that the quantum TDA algorithm [LGZ16] cannot be dequantized. More broadly, we hope that our results will open up new possibilities for quantum advantage in topological data analysis.},

abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can be used to find good approximate solutions to the problem of extremizing a classical cost function defined on bit strings. We study the QAOA in its application to the MaxCut problem and explore how information from classical semi-definite programming (SDP) approximations can be used to improve the performance of the QAOA. In particular, Tate et al. previously constructed a warm-start variant of the QAOA using information from the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, a polynomial-time classical approximation algorithm based on SDP relaxation. We investigate the performance of this SDP-informed, warm-start QAOA on several classes of graphs: bipartite graphs, large random regular graphs, and Karloff graphs (worst-case graphs that saturate the GW approximation guarantee). For these families of graphs, we find that not only does the warm-start variant exhibit superior performance over the standard QAOA, but also it consistently outperforms the GW algorithm even at low depths. For example, with large, random 3-regular graphs, the warm-start QAOA begins to regularly outperform GW starting at depth p = 4. We are able to explore both the ordinary QAOA and the warm-start variant at high-depths by leveraging tensor network techniques, and we believe these techniques may have broader applications in analyzing the QAOA at larger system sizes and higher depths. This work is a step towards understanding how information from classical algorithms can be used to improve their quantum counterparts.},

In the quantum world, on the other hand, there are evidences that some cryptographic primitives can exist even if one-way functions do not exist. We therefore have the following important open problem in quantum cryptography: What is the most fundamental element in quantum cryptography? In this direction, Brakerski, Canetti, and Qian recently defined a notion called EFI pairs, which are pairs of efficiently generatable states that are statistically distinguishable but computationally indistinguishable, and showed its equivalence with some cryptographic primitives including commitments, oblivious transfer, and general multi-party computations. However, their work focuses on decision-type primitives and does not cover search-type primitives like quantum money and digital signatures. In this paper, we study properties of one-way state generators (OWSGs), which are a quantum analogue of one-way functions. We first revisit the definition of OWSGs and generalize it by allowing mixed output states. Then we show the following results. (1) We define a weaker version of OWSGs, weak OWSGs, and show that they are equivalent to OWSGs. (2) Quantum digital signatures are equivalent to OWSGs. (3) Private-key quantum money schemes (with pure money states) imply OWSGs. (4) Quantum pseudo one-time pad schemes imply both OWSGs and EFI pairs. (5) We introduce an incomparable variant of OWSGs, which we call secretly-verifiable and statistically-invertible OWSGs, and show that they are equivalent to EFI pairs.},

abstract = {Distributed quantum computing allows the modular construction of large-scale quantum computers and enables new protocols for verifiably-secure quantum computation. However, such applications place stringent demands on the fidelity and rate of remote logical entanglement generation, which are not met by existing methods for quantum interconnects. In this work, we develop constant-rate entanglement distillation methods to address this bottleneck. By using a sequence of two-way entanglement distillation protocols with increasing rate, we achieve constant-rate entanglement distillation with competitive overhead. We encode the distributed Bell pairs into error-correcting codes prior to distillation, thereby making most efficient use of the noisy, distributed entanglement while only incurring a modest increase in memory footprint. We prove that our protocol achieves a constant expected ratio of physical to logical Bell pairs, for a given input error rate, and perform extensive numerical optimization to identify concrete code sequences with low overhead. We further analyze the possible improvements afforded by our scheme in the execution of concrete distributed algorithms. We find that our scheme outperforms existing quantum interconnect schemes by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards fast, distributed quantum computing.},

Secondly, we describe a novel `soundness amplification' procedure for qLTCs which can increase the soundness of any qLTC to a constant while preserving its distance and dimension, with an impact only felt on its locality. Finally, we apply the AEL distance amplification construction to the case of qLTCs for the first time which can turn a high-distance qLTC into one with linear distance, at the expense of other parameters. These constructions can be used on as-yet undiscovered qLTCs to obtain new parameters, but we also find a number of present applications. Applying these constructions in various combinations to recent advancements yields near-optimal quantum locally testable codes.},

abstract = {Efficiently learning an unknown Hamiltonian given access to its dynamics is a problem of interest for quantum metrology, many-body physics and machine learning. A fundamental question is whether learning can be performed at the Heisenberg limit, where the Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the error, epsilon, in the reconstructed parameters. The Heisenberg limit has previously been shown to be achievable for certain classes of qubit and bosonic Hamiltonians. Most recently, a Heisenberg-limited learning algorithm was proposed for a simplified class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians restricted to real hopping amplitudes and zero chemical potential at all sites, along with on-site interactions. In this work, we provide an algorithm to learn a more general class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit, allowing complex hopping amplitudes and nonzero chemical potentials in addition to the on-site interactions, thereby including several models of physical interest. The required evolution time across all experiments in our protocol is O(1/epsilon) and the number of experiments required to learn all the Hamiltonian parameters is O(polylog(1/epsilon)), independent of system size as long as each fermionic mode interacts with O(1) other modes. Unlike prior algorithms for bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians, to obey fermionic parity superselection constraints in our more general setting, our protocol utilizes O(N) ancillary fermionic modes, where N is the system size. Each experiment involves preparing fermionic Gaussian states, interleaving time evolution with fermionic linear optics unitaries, and performing local occupation number measurements on the fermionic modes. The protocol is robust to a constant amount of state preparation and measurement error.},

This is in contrast to tomography schemes that first reconstruct the complete state, as these often require a greater number of measurements to obtain a reasonably accurate estimate. To be experimentally viable, a central goal of any approach is to accurately estimate the fidelity from as few observations, and types of observations, as possible. We present a technique that designs an experimental measurement protocol of a known target state, finding one that minimizes the width of a nearly optimal minimax confidence interval around the true value of the fidelity. Importantly, the nature of the underlying fidelity estimation scheme means that this design procedure is robust to the availability of measurements, and can be designed prior to the collection of any observations.},

abstract = {Quantum data access and quantum processing can make certain classically intractable learning tasks feasible. However, quantum capabilities will only be available to a select few in the near future. Thus, reliable schemes that allow classical clients to delegate learning to untrusted quantum servers are required to facilitate widespread access to quantum learning advantages. Building on a recently introduced framework of interactive proof systems for classical machine learning by Goldwasser et al. (ITCS 2021), we develop a framework for classical verification of quantum learning. We exhibit learning problems that a classical learner cannot efficiently solve on their own, but that they can efficiently and reliably solve when interacting with an untrusted quantum prover. Concretely, we consider the problems of agnostic learning parities and Fourier-sparse functions with respect to distributions with uniform input marginal. We propose a new quantum data access model that we call "mixture-of-superpositions" quantum examples, based on which we give efficient quantum learning algorithms for these tasks. Moreover, we prove that agnostic quantum parity and Fourier-sparse learning can be efficiently verified by a classical verifier with only random example or statistical query access. Finally, we showcase two general scenarios in learning and verification in which quantum mixture-of-superpositions examples do not lead to sample complexity improvements over classical data. Our results demonstrate that the potential power of quantum data for learning tasks, while not unlimited, can be utilized by classical agents through interaction with untrusted quantum entities.},

abstract = {One of the simplest and most universal methods for implementing the evolution of the Hamiltonian on a quantum computer is the decomposition of the Hamiltonian into Pauli strings (tensor product of Pauli matrices) followed by the application of the Trotter formula. The scaling of error that occurs with this approach has been well studied. It is known that it depends on the commutators between the operators present in the decomposition of the Hamiltonian. It should be noted that this formula provides scaling, but it remains unclear exactly what order of operators minimizes the error. In practical implementations where there are restrictions on circuit length, it is important to minimize the Trotter power required to achieve the required accuracy. In this study, two approaches to determining the optimal order of operators were considered. The first approach is a heuristic method that does not require calculating the exponent, and the second method is based on the use of the annealing method. Both showed a decrease in the Trotter error, while the heuristic method showed particularly high efficiency with a small number of Pauli operators in the decomposition. By using the methods presented here, one can determine an order of operators that helps reduce the error that occurs when using Trotter’s formula.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges in device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is achieving the required Bell violation over long distances, as the channel losses result in low overall detection efficiencies. Recent works have explored the concept of certifying nonlocal correlations over extended distances through the use of a local Bell test. Here, an additional quantum device is placed in close proximity to one party, using short-distance correlations to verify nonlocal behavior at long distances. However, existing works have either not resolved the question of DIQKD security against active attackers in this setup, or used methods that do not yield tight bounds on the keyrates. In this work, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate computation task in this setup that can be combined with recently developed methods for analyzing standard DIQKD. Using this method, we show that if the short-distance devices exhibit sufficiently high detection efficiencies, positive key rates can be achieved in the long-distance branch with lower detection efficiencies as compared to standard DIQKD setups. This highlights the potential for improved performance of DIQKD over extended distances in scenarios where short-distance correlations are leveraged to validate quantum correlations.},

abstract = {A restriction in the quality and quantity of available qubits presents a substantial obstacle to the application of near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers in practical tasks. To confront this challenge, some techniques for effectively augmenting the system size through classical processing have been proposed; one promising approach is quantum circuit cutting. The main idea of quantum circuit cutting is to decompose an original circuit into smaller sub-circuits and combine outputs from these sub-circuits to recover the original output. Although this approach enables us to simulate larger quantum circuits beyond physically available circuits, it needs classical overheads quantified by the two metrics: the sampling overhead in the number of measurements to reconstruct the original output, and the number of channels in the decomposition. Thus, it is crucial to devise a decomposition method that minimizes both of these metrics, thereby reducing the overall execution time. This paper studies the problem of decomposing the $n$-qubit identity channel, i.e., $n$-parallel wire cutting, into a set of local operations and classical communication; then we give an optimal wire-cutting method comprised of channels based on mutually unbiased bases, that achieves minimal overheads in both the sampling overhead and the number of channels, without ancilla qubits. This is in stark contrast to the existing method that achieves the optimal sampling overhead yet with ancilla qubits. Moreover, we derive a tight lower bound of the number of channels in parallel wire cutting without ancilla systems and show that only our method achieves this lower bound among the existing methods. Notably, our method shows an exponential improvement in the number of channels, compared to the aforementioned ancilla-assisted method that achieves optimal sampling overhead.},

abstract = {Magic states, pivotal for universal quantum computation via classically simulable Clifford gates, often undergo decomposition into resourceless stabilizer states, facilitating simulation through classical means. This approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer rank, fidelity, and extent. We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states, marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank – a pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4 under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important result in that direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fidelity of generic states.},

abstract = {We revisit the problem of characterising the complexity of Quantum PAC learning, as introduced by Bshouty and Jackson [1]. Several quantum advantages have been demonstrated in this setting, however, none are generic: they apply to particular concept classes and typically only work when the distribution that generates the data is known. In the general case, it was recently shown by Arunachalam and de Wolf [2] that quantum PAC learners can only achieve constant factor advantages over classical PAC learners. 
We show that with a natural extension of the definition of quantum PAC learning used by Arunachalam and de Wolf, we can achieve a generic advantage in quantum learning. To be precise, for any concept class C of VC dimension d, we show there is an (ϵ,δ)-quantum PAC learner with sample complexity 
O(1/√ϵ[d+log(1/δ)]log^9(1/ϵ)). 
Up to polylogarithmic factors, this is a square root improvement over the classical learning sample complexity. We show the tightness of our result by proving an Ω(d/√ϵ) lower bound that matches our upper bound up to polylogarithmic factors.

abstract = {We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.},

abstract = {Quantum optical systems are typically affected by two types of noise: photon loss and dephasing. Despite extensive research on each noise process individually, a comprehensive understanding of their combined effect is still lacking. A crucial problem lies in determining the values of loss and dephasing for which the resulting loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable, implying the absence of codes capable of correcting its effect or, alternatively, capable of enabling quantum communication. A conjecture in [Quantum 6, 821 (2022)] suggested that the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is not anti-degradable if the loss is below $50%$. In this paper we refute this conjecture, specifically proving that for any value of the loss, if the dephasing is above a critical value, then the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable. While our result identifies a large parameter region where quantum communication is not possible, we also prove that if two-way classical communication is available, then quantum communication — and thus quantum key distribution — is always achievable, even for high values of loss and dephasing.},

Given that states and unitaries appearing in Nature are of bounded gate complexity, it is natural to ask if efficient learning becomes possible. In this work, we prove that to learn a state generated by a quantum circuit with G two-qubit gates to a small trace distance, a sample complexity scaling linearly in G is necessary and sufficient. We also prove that the optimal query complexity to learn a unitary generated by G gates to a small average-case error scales linearly in G. While sample-efficient learning can be achieved, we show that under reasonable cryptographic conjectures, the computational complexity for learning states and unitaries of gate complexity G must scale exponentially in G. We illustrate how these results establish fundamental limitations on the expressivity of quantum machine learning models and provide new perspectives on no-free-lunch theorems in unitary learning. Together, our results answer how the complexity of learning quantum states and unitaries relate to the complexity of creating these states and unitaries.},

abstract = {The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says that, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite being a classical complexity class, however, TFNP has made a surprise appearance in the study of Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT): If a QSAT instance has a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR), then it has a product-state solution [Laumann, Läuchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010]. Efficiently finding this product-state solution, however, has remained elusive. In this work, we introduce a new framework based on Weighted SDRs (WSDR), which among other results, allows us to: (1) significantly simplify and extend the results of [LLMSS 2010] to qudit systems, (2) establish a connection to the Bézout number for multihomogeneous polynomial systems, and (3) apply the parameterized algorithm of [Aldi, de Beaudrap, Gharibian, Saeedi 2021] to solve new instances of QSAT efficiently on qudits. The second of these, in particular, allows us to define the first ""quantum-inspired"" subclass of TFNP, for which we show QSAT with SDR is complete. Thus, we obtain the first evidence that QSAT with SDR is, in fact, intractable.},

abstract = {Analog quantum simulation is a promising path towards solving classically intractable problems in many-body physics on near-term quantum devices. However, the presence of noise limits the size of the system and the length of time that can be simulated. In our work, we consider an error model in which the actual Hamiltonian of the simulator differs from the target Hamiltonian we want to simulate by small local perturbations, which are assumed to be random and unbiased. We analyze the error accumulated in observables in this setting and show that, due to stochastic error cancellation, with high probability the error scales as the square root of the number of qubits instead of linearly. We explore the concentration phenomenon of this error as well as its implications for local observables in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that stochastic error cancellation also manifests in the fidelity between the target state at the end of time-evolution and the actual state we obtain in the presence of noise. This indicates that, to reach a certain fidelity, more noise can be tolerated than implied by the worst-case bound if the noise comes from many statistically independent sources.},

Quantum resource theories provide a unified framework to analyze and understand such properties, as successfully demonstrated for entanglement and coherence. While these are examples of convex resources, for which quantum advantages can always be identified, many physical resources are described by a nonconvex set of free states and their interpretation has so far remained elusive. Here we address the fundamental question of the usefulness of quantum resources without convexity assumption, by providing two operational interpretations of the generalized robustness measure in general resource theories. First, we characterize the generalized robustness in terms of a nonlinear resource witness and reveal that any state is more advantageous than a free one in some multicopy channel discrimination task. Next, we consider a scenario where a theory is characterized by multiple constraints and show that the generalized robustness coincides with the worst-case advantage in a single-copy channel discrimination setting. Based on these characterizations, we conclude that every quantum resource state shows a qualitative and quantitative advantage in discrimination problems in a general resource theory even without any specification on the structure of the free states.},

Then, we analytically characterize the training of the network via gradient descent with square loss on supervised learning problems. We prove that, as long as the network is not affected by barren plateaus, the trained network can perfectly fit the training set and that the probability distribution of the function generated after training still converges in distribution to a Gaussian process.

First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality O(log⋆n) in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the Θ(log⋆n) complexity class by using non-signaling arguments. 
Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for rooted trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality o(loglogn) in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality O(log⋆n) in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. Put together, these results show that in rooted trees the set of LCLs that can be solved with locality O(log⋆n) is the same across all these models: classical deterministic and randomized LOCAL, quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, and deterministic and randomized online-LOCAL.},

This holds even considering parallel quantum algorithms. 
* (The DL problem, hybrid/memory-bounded setting) We observe that some (known) variations of Shor's algorithm can take advantage of classical computations to reduce the number and depth of quantum group operations. We establish a model for generic hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and prove the matching lower bounds. We also study the memory-bounded setting and establish asymptotically tight lower bounds. We extend these results to the multiple-instance DL problem with a matching new algorithm. * (Integer factorization) We give a logarithmic lower bound for the order-finding algorithms, an important step for Shor's algorithm.

In this study, we establish fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources, where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity. Lastly, we show that the transformation from a complex to a real model of quantum computation is inefficient, in contrast to the reverse process, which is efficient. Our results establish fundamental limits on property testing and provide valuable insights into quantum pseudorandomness.},

abstract = {Despite the fundamental role the Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT) problem has played in quantum complexity theory, a central question remains open: At which local dimension does the complexity of QSAT transition from ""easy"" to ""hard""? 
Here, we study QSAT with each constraint acting on a k-dimensional and l-dimensional qudit pair, denoted (k,l)-QSAT. 
Our first main result shows that, surprisingly, QSAT on qubits can remain QMA_1-hard, in that (2,5)-QSAT is QMA_1-complete. (QMA_1 is a quantum analogue of MA with perfect completeness.) 
In contrast, (2,2)-QSAT (i.e. Quantum 2-SAT on qubits) is well-known to be poly-time solvable [Bravyi, 2006]. Our second main result proves that (3,d)-QSAT on the 1D line with d = O(1) is also QMA_1-hard. 
Finally, we initiate the study of (2,d)-QSAT on the 1D line by giving a frustration-free 1D Hamiltonian with a unique, entangled ground state. 
As implied by our title, our first result uses a direct embedding: We combine a novel clock construction with the 2D circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction of [Gosset and Nagaj, 2013]. 
Of note is a new simplified and analytic proof for the latter (as opposed to a partially numeric proof in [GN13]). This exploits Unitary Labelled Graphs [Bausch, Cubitt, Ozols, 2017] together with a new ""Nullspace Connection Lemma"", allowing us to break low energy analyses into small patches of projectors, and to improve the soundness analysis of [GN13] from Omega(1/T^6) to Omega(1/T^2), for T the number of gates. Our second result goes via black-box reduction: Given an arbitrary 1D Hamiltonian H on d'-dimensional qudits, we show how to embed it into an effective 1D (3,d)-QSAT instance, for d = O(1). Our approach may be viewed as a weaker notion of ""simulation"" (à la [Bravyi, Hastings 2017], [Cubitt, Montanaro, Piddock 2018]). As far as we are aware, this gives the first ""black-box simulation""-based QMA_1-hardness result.},

abstract = {The experimental realization of increasingly complex quantum states underscores the pressing need for new methods of state learning and verification. In one such framework, quantum state tomography, the aim is to learn the full quantum state from data obtained by measurements. Without prior assumptions on the state, this task is prohibitively hard. Here, we present an efficient algorithm for learning states on n fermion modes prepared by any number of Gaussian and at most t non-Gaussian gates. By Jordan-Wigner mapping, this also includes n-qubit states prepared by nearest-neighbour matchgate circuits with at most t SWAP-gates. Our algorithm is based exclusively on single-copy measurements and produces a classical representation of a state, guaranteed to be close in trace distance to the target state. The sample and time complexity of our algorithm is poly(n,2t); thus if t=O(log(n)), it is efficient. We also show that, if t scales slightly more than logarithmically, any learning algorithm to solve the same task must be inefficient, under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide an efficient property testing algorithm that, given access to copies of a state, determines whether such state is far or close to the set of states for which our learning algorithm works. Beyond tomography, our work sheds light on the structure of states prepared with few non-Gaussian gates and offers an improved upper bound on their circuit complexity.},

The algorithm has thus the fastest scaling possible for this class of states. We also show that measurement and feedback leads to an exponential speedup of the algorithm to T = O[log log(N/ε)]. Measurements also allow one to prepare arbitrary translation-invariant MPS, including long-range non-normal ones, in the same depth. Finally, the algorithm naturally extends to inhomogeneous MPS.},

abstract = {Density-functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized computer simulations in chemistry and material science. A faithful implementation of the theory requires self-consistent calculations. However, this effort involves repeatedly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, for which a classical algorithm typically requires a computational complexity that scales cubically with respect to the number of electrons. This limits DFT's applicability to large-scale problems with complex chemical environments and microstructures. This article presents a quantum algorithm that has a linear scaling with respect to the number of atoms, which is much smaller than the number of electrons. Our algorithm leverages the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) to generate a quantum circuit to encode the density-matrix, and an estimation method for computing the output electron density. In addition, we present a randomized block coordinate fixed-point method to accelerate the self-consistent field calculations by reducing the number of components of the electron density that needs to be estimated. The proposed framework is accompanied by a rigorous error analysis that quantifies the function approximation error, the statistical fluctuation, and the iteration complexity. In particular, the analysis of our self-consistent iterations takes into account the measurement noise from the quantum circuit. These advancements offer a promising avenue for tackling large-scale DFT problems, enabling simulations of complex systems that were previously computationally infeasible.},

It is unknown though, whether these limits are still achievable in restricted quantum devices when QEC is unavailable, e.g., with only unitary controls or bounded system sizes. In this talk, I will discuss various new limits for estimating qubit channels under restrictive controls. The HL is proven to be unachievable in various cases, indicating the necessity of QEC in achieving the HL. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve the SQL is determined, where a novel unitary control protocol is identified to achieve the SQL for certain types of noisy channels, and a constant floor on the estimation error is proven for other cases.},

Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP circuit undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise, the output distribution can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer after a critical $O(1)$ depth. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum supremacy tasks, we do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture, on anti-concentration properties, nor do we require $Ømega(łog(n))$ circuit depth. We take advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of diagonal gates, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a large-scale breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest that quantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more susceptible to classical simulation than previously thought.},

However, analytical and numerical characterizations of magic are very challenging, especially for multi-qubit systems, even with a moderate qubit number. Here, we systemically and analytically investigate the magic resource of archetypal multipartite quantum states—quantum hypergraph states, which can be generated by multi-qubit controlled-phase gates encoded by hypergraphs. We first derive the magic formula in terms of the stabilizer R$mathrmacutee$nyi-α entropies for general quantum hypergraph states. If the average degree of the corresponding hypergraph is constant, we show that magic cannot reach the maximal value, i.e., the number of qubits $n$. Then, we investigate the statistical behaviors of random hypergraph states' magic and prove a concentration result, indicating that random hypergraph states typically reach the maximum magic. This also suggests an efficient way to generate maximal magic states with random diagonal circuits. Finally, we study hypergraph states with permutation symmetry, such as $3$-complete hypergraph states, where any three vertices are connected by a hyperedge. Counterintuitively, such states can only possess constant or even exponentially small magic for $alphageq 2$. Our study advances the understanding of multipartite quantum magic and could lead to applications in quantum computing and quantum many-body physics.},

To tackle this challenge, we propose the framework of virtual combs that exploit the unknown process iteratively with additional classical post-processing to simulate the process inverse. Our research establishes a path to achieving the exact inverse of unknown channels with certain conditions, accompanied by a no-go theorem that underscores the intrinsic limitations imposed by quantum mechanics on such tasks. Notably, we demonstrate that an n-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse a depolarizing channel with one unknown noise parameter out of n+1 potential candidates, and a 1-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse an arbitrary pair of quantum channels. We further explore the approximate inverse of an unknown channel within a given channel set. For any unknown depolarizing channels within a specified noise region, we unveil a worst-case error decay of O(n^−1) of reversing the channel via virtual combs. Moreover, we show that virtual combs with constant slots can be applied to universally reverse unitary operations and investigate the trade-off between the slot number and the sampling overhead.},

abstract = {The essential requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is the total protocol design to achieve a fair balance of all the critical factors relevant to its practical realization, such as the space overhead, the threshold, and the modularity. A major obstacle in realizing FTQC with conventional protocols, such as those based on the surface code and the concatenated Steane code, has been the space overhead, i.e., the required number of physical qubits per logical qubit. Protocols based on high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes gather considerable attention as a way to reduce the space overhead, but problematically, the existing fault-tolerant protocols for such quantum LDPC codes sacrifice the other factors. Here we construct a new fault-tolerant protocol to meet these requirements simultaneously based on more recent progress on the techniques for concatenated codes rather than quantum LDPC codes, achieving a constant space overhead, a high threshold, and flexibility in modular architecture designs. In particular, under a physical error rate of 0.1%, our protocol reduces the space overhead to achieve the logical CNOT error rates 10^-10 and 10^-24 by more than 90% and 97%, respectively, compared to the protocol for the surface code. Furthermore, our protocol achieves the threshold of 2.4% under a conventional circuit-level error model, substantially outperforming that of the surface code. The use of concatenated codes also naturally introduces abstraction layers essential for the modularity of FTQC architectures. These results indicate that the code-concatenation approach opens a way to significantly save qubits in realizing FTQC while fulfilling the other essential requirements for the practical protocol design.},

abstract = {Given that reliable cloud quantum computers are becoming closer to reality, the concept of delegation of quantum computations and its verifiability is of central interest. Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a quantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the client specifies the size n of the computation and receives an untrusted, off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a single measurement. 
We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS model. This also yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This provides the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover zero-knowledge proof system for QMA. As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for n EPR pairs using only constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification. Along the way, we also provide an enhanced version of a well-known stability result due to Gowers and Hatami and show how it completes a common argument used in self-testing.},

abstract = {Notions of nonstabilizerness, or ``magic'', quantify how non-classical quantum states are in a precise sense: states exhibiting low nonstabilizerness preclude quantum advantage. We introduce `pseudomagic' ensembles of quantum states that, despite low nonstabilizerness, are computationally indistinguishable from those with high nonstabilizerness. Previously, such computational indistinguishability has been studied with respect to entanglement, introducing the concept of pseudoentanglement. However, we demonstrate that pseudomagic neither follows from pseudoentanglement nor implies it. In terms of applications, the study of pseudomagic offers fresh insights into the theory of quantum scrambling: it uncovers states that, even though they originate from non-scrambling unitaries, remain indistinguishable from scrambled states to any physical observer. Additional applications include new lower bounds on state synthesis problems, property testing protocols, and implications for quantum cryptography. Our work is driven by the observation that only quantities measurable by a computationally bounded observer – intrinsically limited by finite-time computational constraints – hold physical significance. Ultimately, our findings suggest that nonstabilizerness is a `hide-able' characteristic of quantum states: some states are much more magical than is apparent to a computationally bounded observer.},

abstract = {Problems based on the structure of graphs – for example finding cliques, independent sets, or colourings – are of fundamental importance in classical complexity. It is well motivated to consider similar problems about quantum graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs. Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs faces several technical challenges, and consequently the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored. 
In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels induced by circuits, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We also use this approach to reimagine the clique and independent set problems for classical graphs, by taking the inputs to be circuits of deterministic or noisy channels which implicitly determine confusability graphs. We show that, by varying the collection of channels in the language, these give rise to complete problems for the classes NP, MA, QMA, and QMA(2). In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantisation is QMA(2), rather than QMA, which is commonly assumed. To prove the results in the quantum case, we make use of methods inspired by self-testing. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we include a new proof of the reduction of QMA(k) to QMA(2) via cliques for quantum graphs. We also study the complexity of a version of the independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical case where the clique and independent set problems are equivalent.},

abstract = {Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that higher entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of 'quantumness'. However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises a question: what are the differences between 'low-magic' entanglement, and 'high-magic' entanglement? We answer this question in this work with a rigorous investigation into the role of magic in entanglement theory. We take an operational approach to understanding this relationship by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation and dilution. This approach reveals that magic has surprisingly strong implications for entanglement. Specifically, we find a sharp operational separation that splits Hilbert space into two distinct phases: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase and magic-dominated (MD) phase. Roughly speaking, ED states have entanglement that significantly surpasses their magic, while MD states have magic that dominates their entanglement. The competition between the two resources in these two phases induces a computational phase separation between them: there are sample- and time-efficient quantum algorithms for almost any entanglement task on ED states, while these tasks are provably computationally intractable in the MD phase. To demonstrate the power of our results beyond entanglement theory, we highlight the relevance of our findings in many-body physics and topological error correction. Additionally, we offer simple theoretical explanations for phenomenological observations made in previous numerical studies using ED-MD phases.},

abstract = {Stopping power is the rate at which a material absorbs the kinetic energy of a charged particle passing through it – one of many properties needed over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in modeling inertial fusion implosions. First-principles stopping calculations are classically challenging because they involve the dynamics of large electronic systems far from equilibrium, with accuracies that are particularly difficult to constrain and assess in the warm-dense conditions preceding ignition. Here, we describe a protocol for using a fault-tolerant quantum computer to calculate stopping power from a first-quantized representation of the electrons and projectile. Our approach builds upon the electronic structure block encodings of Su et al. [PRX Quantum 2, 040332 2021], adapting and optimizing those algorithms to estimate observables of interest from the non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics of multiple particle species at finite temperature. We also work out the constant factors associated with a novel implementation of a high-order Trotter approach to simulating a grid representation of these systems. Ultimately, we report logical qubit requirements and leading-order Toffoli costs for computing the stopping power of various projectile/target combinations relevant to interpreting and designing inertial fusion experiments. We estimate that scientifically interesting and classically intractable stopping power calculations can be quantum simulated with roughly the same number of logical qubits and about one hundred times more Toffoli gates than is required for state-of-the-art quantum simulations of industrially relevant molecules such as FeMoco or P450.},

This generalizes the result from Vidick [JMP 2022], which only applies to finite-dimensional quantum correlations. Furthermore, we extend the state-dependent norm variant of the Gowers-Hatami theorem to finite von Neumann algebras. Combined with the aforementioned characterization, this enables us to lift many known results about robust self-testing for non-local games to the commuting operator model, including a sample efficient EPR testing for the commuting operator strategies.

abstract = {Quantum nondeterministic distributed computing was recently introduced as dQMA (distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur) protocols by Fraigniaud, Le Gall, Nishimura and Paz (ITCS 2021). In dQMA protocols, with the help of quantum proofs and local communication, nodes on a network verify a global property of the network. Fraigniaud et al. showed that, when the network size is small, there exists an exponential separation in proof size between distributed classical and quantum verification protocols, for the equality problem, where the verifiers check if all the data owned by a subset of them are identical. In this paper, we further investigate and characterize the power of the dQMA protocols for various decision problems. 
First, we give a more efficient dQMA protocol for the equality problem with a simpler analysis. This is done by adding a symmetrization step on each node and exploiting properties of the permutation test, which is a generalization of the SWAP test. We also show a quantum advantage for the equality problem on path networks still persists even when the network size is large, by considering ``relay points'' between extreme nodes. 
Second, we show that even in a general network, there exist efficient dQMA protocols for the ranking verification problem, the Hamming distance problem, and more problems that derive from efficient quantum one-way communication protocols. Third, in a line network, we construct an efficient dQMA protocol for a problem that has an efficient two-party QMA communication protocol. Finally, we obtain the first lower bounds on the proof and communication cost of dQMA protocols. To prove a lower bound on the equality problem, we show any dQMA protocol with an entangled proof between nodes can be simulated with a dQMA protocol with a separable proof between nodes by using a QMA communication-complete problem introduced by Raz and Shpilka (CCC 2004).},

Two primary regimes exist - deterministic PBT in which teleportation is always successful, but is imperfect, and probabilistic PBT, in which teleportation succeeds with probability less than one, but teleportation is perfect upon a success. Two further regimes exist within each of these in which the resource state used for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state, or free to be optimised. 
Recently, works resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for qudits. Here, we provide algorithms in all four regimes for qubits. Emphasis is placed on the practicality of these algorithms, where we give polynomial improvements in the known gate complexity for PBT, as well as an exponential improvement in the required number of ancillas (albeit in separate protocols). Our approach to the implementation of the square-root measurement in PBT can be directly generalised to other highly symmetric state ensembles. For certain families of states, such a framework yields efficient algorithms in the case that the Petz recovery algorithm for the square-root measurement runs in exponential time.},

Prior work of Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen [FOCS '19] further shows (via a technique called simulatable codes) that every language in MIP* has a perfect zero knowledge (PZK) MIP* protocol. The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-round proof systems, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However, the construction in Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen uses six provers, and there is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via simulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZK-MIP* protocols for all of MIP*? In this paper, we show that every language in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK-MIP* protocol, answering the question in the affirmative. For the proof, we use a new method based on a key consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem, which is that every MIP* protocol can be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games. This makes it possible to work with MIP* protocols as boolean constraint systems, and in particular allows us to use a variant of a construction due to Dwork, Feige, Kilian, Naor, and Safra [Crypto '92] which gives a classical MIP protocol for 3SAT with perfect zero knowledge. To show quantum soundness of this classical construction, we develop a toolkit for analyzing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games, which we expect to be useful more broadly. This toolkit also applies to commuting operator strategies, and our argument shows that every language with a commuting operator BCS protocol has a two prover PZK commuting operator protocol.},

abstract = {Quantum Tanner codes constitute a family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with good parameters, i.e., constant encoding rate and relative distance. In this article, we prove that quantum Tanner codes also facilitate single-shot quantum error correction (QEC) of adversarial noise, where one measurement round (consisting of constant-weight parity checks) suffices to perform reliable QEC even in the presence of measurement errors. We establish this result for both the sequential and parallel decoding algorithms introduced by Leverrier and Zemor. Furthermore, we show that in order to suppress errors over multiple repeated rounds of QEC, it suffices to run the parallel decoding algorithm for constant time in each round. Combined with good code parameters, the resulting constant-time overhead of QEC and robustness to (possibly time-correlated) adversarial noise make quantum Tanner codes alluring from the perspective of quantum fault-tolerant protocols.},

abstract = {In this work, we prove uniform continuity bounds for entropic quantities related to the sandwiched Rényi divergences such as the sandwiched Rényi conditional entropy. We follow three different approaches: The first one is the axiomatic approach, which exploits the sub-/ superadditivity and joint concavity/ convexity of the exponential of the divergence. In our second approach, termed the "operator space approach", we express the entropic measures as norms and utilize their properties for establishing the bounds. These norms draw inspiration from interpolation space norms. We not only demonstrate the norm properties solely relying on matrix analysis tools but also extend their applicability to a context that holds relevance in resource theories. By this, we extend the strategies of Marwah and Dupuis as well as Beigi and Goodarzi employed in the sandwiched Rényi conditional entropy context. Finally, we merge the approaches into a mixed approach that has some advantageous properties and then discuss in which regimes each bound performs best. Our results improve over the previous best continuity bounds or sometimes even give the first continuity bounds available. In a separate contribution, we use the ALAAF method, developed in a previous article by some of the authors, to study the stability of approximate quantum Markov chains.},

abstract = {Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is in fact local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown Hamiltonian H is k-local or epsilon-far from all k-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along H. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require at least order 2^n many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of order 2^n/epsilon, and even coherent testers need at least order 2^(n/2) many queries and order 2^(n/2)/epsilon total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.},

abstract = {Learning tasks play an increasingly prominent role in quantum information and computation. They range from fundamental problems such as state discrimination and metrology over the framework of quantum probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, to the recently proposed shadow variants of state tomography. However, the many directions of quantum learning theory have so far evolved separately. We propose a general mathematical formalism for describing quantum learning by training on classical-quantum data and then testing how well the learned hypothesis generalizes to new data. In this framework, we prove bounds on the expected generalization error of a quantum learner in terms of classical and quantum mutual information quantities measuring how strongly the learner's hypothesis depends on the specific data seen during training. To achieve this, we use tools from quantum optimal transport and quantum concentration inequalities to establish non-commutative versions of decoupling lemmas that underlie recent information-theoretic generalization bounds for classical machine learning. Our framework encompasses and gives intuitively accessible generalization bounds for a variety of quantum learning scenarios such as quantum state discrimination, PAC learning quantum states, quantum parameter estimation, and quantumly PAC learning classical functions. Thereby, our work lays a foundation for a unifying quantum information-theoretic perspective on quantum learning.},

abstract = {The popular qubit framework has dominated recent work on quantum kernel machine learning, with results characterising expressivity, learnability and generalisation. As yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these concepts for continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this paper we represent CV quantum kernels as closed form functions and use this representation to provide several important theoretical insights. We derive a general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and show every such kernel can be expressed as the product of Gaussian and algebraic function terms. Furthermore, we present quantification of a quantum-classical separation for all quantum kernels via a hierarchical notion of the ``stellar rank" of the quantum kernel feature map. For a particular subclass of CV kernels, we are able to directly extend this notion to the kernels themselves. In all such cases we can quantify the hardness of classical simulability of the quantum kernel. We then prove kernels defined by feature maps of infinite stellar rank, such as GKP-state encodings, can be approximated arbitrarily well by kernels defined by feature maps of finite stellar rank. Finally, we simulate learning with a single-mode displaced Fock state encoding and show that (i) accuracy on our specific task (an annular data set) increases with stellar rank, (ii) for underfit models, accuracy can be improved by increasing a bandwidth hyperparameter, and (iii) for noisy data that is overfit, decreasing the bandwidth will improve generalisation but does so at the cost of effective stellar rank and thus quantum advantage.},

In this primitive, the signing key is a quantum state which enables a user to sign many messages and yet, the quantum key is also revocable, i.e., it can be collapsed into a classical certificate which can later be verified. Once the key is successfully revoked, we require that the initial recipient of the key loses the ability to sign. We construct digital signatures with revocable signing keys from a newly introduced primitive which we call two-tier one-shot signatures, which may be of independent interest. This is a variant of one-shot signatures, where the verification of a signature for the message ``0'' is done publicly, whereas the verification for the message ``1'' is done in private. We give a construction of two-tier one-shot signatures from the LWE assumption. As a complementary result, we also construct digital signatures with quantum revocation from group actions, where the quantum signing key is simply ``returned'' and then verified as part of revocation. Second, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signatures from OWFs. In this primitive, the signer can produce quantum signatures which can later be revoked. Here, the security property requires that, once revocation is successful, the initial recipient of the signature loses the ability to find accepting inputs to the signature verification algorithm. We construct this primitive using a newly introduced two-tier variant of tokenized signatures. For the construction, we show a new lemma which we call the adaptive hardcore bit property for OWFs, which may enable further applications.},

abstract = {We present a framework for quantum computation, similar to Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC), that is based on the quantum Zeno effect. By performing randomised dephasing operations at intervals determined by a Poisson process, we are able to track the eigenspace associated to a particular eigenvalue. We derive a simple differential equation for the fidelity leading to general theorems bounding the time complexity of a whole class of algorithms. We also use eigenstate filtering to optimise the scaling of the complexity in the error tolerance ε. In many cases the bounds given by our general theorems are optimal, giving a time complexity of O(1/Δ) with Δ the minimum of the gap. This allows us to prove optimal results using very general features of problems, minimising the amount of problem-specific insight necessary. As two applications of our framework we obtain optimal scaling for the Grover problem (i.e. O(N^1/2) where N is the database size) and the Quantum Linear System Problem (i.e. O(κłog(1/ε)) where κ is the condition number and ε the error tolerance) by direct applications of our theorems.},

We overcome these limitations, proposing a quantum advantage demonstration amenable to experimental realizations. Subexponential circuit-complexity lower bounds have traditionally been referred to as exponential.

abstract = {Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the robust shallow shadows protocol. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.},

abstract = {Secret sharing allows a user to split a secret into many shares so that the secret can be recovered if, and only if, an authorized set of shares is collected. Although secret sharing typically does not require any computational hardness assumptions, its security does require that an adversary cannot collect an authorized set of shares. Over long periods of time where an adversary can benefit from multiple data breaches, this may become an unrealistic assumption. 
 We initiate the systematic study of secret sharing with certified deletion in order to achieve security even against an adversary that eventually collects an authorized set of shares. In secret sharing with certified deletion, a (classical) secret 
s is split into quantum shares that can be destroyed in a manner verifiable by the dealer. 
 We put forth two natural definitions of security. No-signaling security roughly requires that if multiple non-communicating adversaries delete sufficiently many shares, then their combined view contains negligible information about s, even if the total set of corrupted parties forms an authorized set. Adaptive security requires privacy of s against an adversary that can continuously and adaptively corrupt new shares and delete previously-corrupted shares, as long as the total set of corrupted shares minus deleted shares remains unauthorized. Next, we show that these security definitions are achievable: we show how to construct (i) a secret sharing scheme with no-signaling certified deletion for any monotone access structure, and (ii) a threshold secret sharing scheme with adaptive certified deletion. Our first construction uses Bartusek and Khurana's (CRYPTO 2023) 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme with certified deletion as a building block, while our second construction is built from scratch and requires several new technical ideas. For example, we significantly generalize the ``XOR extractor'' of Agarwal, Bartusek, Khurana, and Kumar (EUROCRYPT 2023) in order to obtain better seedless extraction from certain quantum sources of entropy, and show how polynomial interpolation can double as a high-rate randomness extractor in our context of threshold sharing with certified deletion.},

In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the q-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠, then 𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖯[q] is in 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠 for any constant q.

Moreover, we also show that there exists (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false.

abstract = {One of the founding results of lattice based cryptography is a quantum reduction from the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem to the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem introduced by Regev. It has recently been pointed out by Chen, Liu and Zhandry[CLZ22] that this reduction can be made more powerful by replacing the LWE problem with a quantum equivalent, where the errors are given in quantum superposition. In parallel, Regev's reduction has recently been adapted in the context of code-based cryptography by Debris, Remaud and Tillich[DRT23], who showed a reduction between the Short Codeword Problem and the Decoding Problem (the DRT reduction). This motivates the study of the Quantum Decoding Problem (QDP), which is the Decoding Problem but with errors in quantum superposition and see how it behaves in the DRT reduction. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and to lay a firm foundation for QDP. We first show QD Pis likely to be easier than classical decoding, by proving that it can be solved in quantum polynomial time in a large regime of noise whereas no non-exponential quantum algorithm is known for the classical decoding problem. Then, we show that QDP can even be solved (albeit not necessarily efficiently) beyond the information theoretic Shannon limit for classical decoding. We give precisely the largest noise level where we can solve QDP giving in a sense the information theoretic limit for this new problem. Finally, we study how QDP can be used in the DRT reduction. First, we show that our algorithms can be properly used in the DRT reduction showing that our quantum algorithms for QDP beyond Shannon capacity can be used to find minimal weight codewords in a random code. On the negative side, we show that the DRT reduction cannot be, in all generality, a reduction between finding small codewords and QDP by exhibiting quantum algorithms for QDP where this reduction entirely fails. Our proof techniques include the use of specific quantum measurements, such as q-ary unambiguous state discrimination and pretty good measurements as well as strong concentration bounds on weight distribution of random shifted dual codes, which we relate using quantum Fourier analysis.},

imately (say, up to an error ε), can one find a new channel and a state, which are 
respectively close to the original ones, such that they satisfy an exact fixed point equa- 
tion? It is interesting to ask this question for different choices of constraints on the 
structures of the original channel and state, and requiring that these are also satisfied 
by the new channel and state. We affirmatively answer the above question, under 
fairly general assumptions on these structures, through a compactness argument. Ad- 
ditionally, for channels and states satisfying certain specific structures, we find explicit 
upper bounds on the distances between the pairs of channels (and states) in question. 
When these distances decay quickly (in a particular, desirable manner) as ε → 0, we 
say that the original approximate fixed point equation is rapidly fixable. We establish 
rapid fixability, not only for general quantum channels, but also when the original and 
new channels are both required to be unitary, mixed unitary or unital. In contrast, 
for the case of bipartite quantum systems with channels acting trivially on one subsys- 
tem, we prove that approximate fixed point equations are not rapidly fixable. In this 
case, the distance to the closest channel (and state) which satisfy an exact fixed point 
equation can depend on the dimension of the quantum system in an undesirable way. 
We apply our results on approximate fixed point equations to the question of robust- 
ness of quantum Markov chains (QMC) and establish the following: For any tripartite 
quantum state, there exists a dimension-dependent upper bound on its distance to the 
set of QMCs, which decays to zero as the conditional mutual information of the state vanishes.},

abstract = {Barren plateaus have emerged as a pivotal challenge for variational quantum computing. Our understanding of this phenomenon underwent a transformative shift with the recent introduction of a Lie algebraic theory capable of explaining most sources of barren plateaus. However, this theory requires either initial states or observables that lie in the circuit's Lie algebra. Focusing on parametrized matchgate circuits, in this work we are able to go beyond this assumption and provide an exact formula for the loss function variance that is valid for arbitrary input states and measurements. Our results reveal that new phenomena emerge when the Lie algebra constraint is relaxed. For instance, we find that the variance does not necessarily vanish inversely with the Lie algebra's dimension. Instead, this measure of expressiveness is replaced by a generalized expressiveness quantity: the dimension of the Lie group modules. By characterizing the operators in these modules as products of Majorana operators, we can introduce a precise notion of generalized globality and show that measuring generalized-global operators leads to barren plateaus. Our work also provides operational meaning to the generalized entanglement as we connect it with known fermionic entanglement measures, and show that it satisfies a monogamy relation. Finally, while parameterized matchgate circuits are not efficiently simulable in general, our results suggest that the structure allowing for trainability may also lead to classical simulability.},

The runtime of the algorithm scales linearly with the number of qubits for any constant circuit depth and spatial dimension. We also show that the operator-norm distance to the identity || U - I || can be efficiently approximated within a factor alpha = 5 for shallow 1D circuits and, under a certain technical condition, within a factor alpha = 2D + 3 for shallow D-dimensional circuits. A numerical implementation of the identity check algorithm is reported for 1D Trotter circuits with up to 100 qubits.},

First, we provide a quantum algorithm with query complexity $tildeO(N^1/3)$ for testing clusterability, which yields a polynomial speedup over the best classical clusterability tester known [Florian Adriaens and Simon Apers. Testing cluster properties of signed graphs.]. Second, we prove an $tildeØmega(sqrtN)$ classical query lower bound for testing clusterability, which nearly matches the upper bound from citeadriaens2021testing. This settles the classical query complexity of clusterability testing, and it shows that our quantum algorithm has an advantage over any classical algorithm.},

abstract = {A major obstacle for quantum optimizers is the reformulation of constraints as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Current QUBO translators exaggerate the weight M of the penalty terms. Classically known as the "Big-M" problem, the issue becomes even more daunting for quantum solvers, since it affects the physical energy scale. We take a systematic, encompassing look at the quantum big-M problem, revealing NP-hardness in finding the optimal M and establishing bounds on the Hamiltonian spectral gap Δ, inversely related to the expected run-time of quantum solvers. We propose a practical translation algorithm, based on SDP relaxation, that outperforms previous methods in numerical benchmarks. Our algorithm gives values of Δ orders of magnitude greater, e.g. for portfolio optimization instances. Solving such instances with an adiabatic algorithm on 6-qubits of an IonQ device, we observe significant advantages in time to solution and average solution quality. Our findings are relevant to quantum and quantum-inspired solvers alike.},

In this work, we continue the study initiated by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) of compiled nonlocal games, played between a classical verifier and a single cryptographically limited quantum device. Our main result is that the compiler proposed by Kalai et al. is sound for any two-player XOR game. A celebrated theorem of Tsirelson shows that for XOR games, the quantum value is exactly given by a semidefinite program, and we obtain our result by showing that the SDP upper bound holds for the compiled game up to a negligible error arising from the compilation. This answers a question raised by Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23), who showed soundness for the specific case of the CHSH game. Using our techniques, we obtain several additional results, including (1) tight bounds on the compiled value of parallel-repeated XOR games, (2) operator self-testing statements for any compiled XOR game, and (3) a ``nice" sum-of-squares certificate for any XOR game, from which operator rigidity is manifest.},

We prove that tomography of these systems is extremely inefficient in terms of time resources, much more so than tomography of qudit systems: the minimum number of state copies needed for tomography not only scales exponentially with the number of modes but also exhibits a dramatic scaling with the trace-distance error, even for low-energy states. On a more positive note, we prove that tomography of Gaussian states is efficient. To accomplish this, we answer a fundamental question for the field of continuous-variable quantum information: if we know with a certain error the first and second moments of an unknown Gaussian state, what is the resulting trace-distance error that we make on the state? Lastly, we demonstrate that tomography of non-Gaussian states prepared through Gaussian unitaries and a few local non-Gaussian evolutions is efficient and experimentally feasible.},

Thus, to construct a CC-efficient quantum oracle for a function, it suffices to solve the simpler problem of designing a CC-efficient classical algorithm for the function. This transformation also allows us to leverage the vast body of work on classical pebbling games for developing parallel quantum circuits with low amortized space-time complexity, given the data-dependency graph of the problem.},

abstract = {We make progress in understanding the relationship between learning models with access to entangled, separable and statistical measurements in the quantum statistical query (QSQ) model. We show the following results. 
Entangled versus separable measurements: 
The goal is to learn an unknown f from the concept class C containing functions from 0,1^n to [k] given copies of a uniform superposition over |x,f(x)&gt;. We show that, if T copies suffice to learn f using entangled measurements, O(nT^2) copies suffice to learn f using only separable measurements. 
Entangled versus statistical measurements: 
The goal is to learn a function f in C given access to separable measurements or statistical measurements. We exhibit a concept class C based of degree-2 functions with exponential separation between QSQ learning and quantum learning with entangled measurements (even in the presence of noise). This proves the ""quantum analogue"" of the seminal result of Blum et al. that separates classical SQ learning from classical PAC learning with classification noise. 
QSQ lower bounds for learning states: 
We introduce a quantum statistical query dimension (QSD), and use it to give lower bounds on the QSQ complexity of learning. We prove superpolynomial QSQ lower bounds for testing purity of quantum states, shadow tomography, learning coset states for the Abelian hidden subgroup problem, degree-2 functions, planted biclique states, and learning output states of Clifford circuits of depth polylog(n). We also show that an extension of QSD characterizes the complexity of general search problems. 
Further applications: We give an unconditional separation between weak and strong error mitigation and prove lower bounds for learning distributions in the QSQ model. Prior works by Quek et al., Hinsche et al., and Nietner et al. proved analogous results assuming diagonal measurements and our work removes this assumption.},

abstract = {A basic question in the PAC model of learning is whether proper learning is harder than improper learning. In the classical case, there are examples of concept classes with VC dimension d that have sample complexity Ω(d/ϵ log(1/ϵ)) for proper learning with error ϵ, while the complexity for improper learning is O(d/ϵ). One such example arises from the Coupon Collector problem. 
Motivated by the efficiency of proper versus improper learning with quantum samples, Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC 2020) studied an analogue, the Quantum Coupon Collector problem. Curiously, they discovered that for learning size k subsets of [n] the problem has sample complexity Θ(k log mink,n−k+1), in contrast with the complexity of Θ(k log k) for Coupon Collector. This effectively negates the possibility of a separation between the two modes of learning via the quantum problem, and Arunachalam et al. posed the possibility of such a separation as an open question. In this work, we first present an algorithm for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem with sample complexity that matches the sharper lower bound of (1−o_k(1))k ln mink,n−k+1 shown recently by Bab Hadiashar, Nayak, and Sinha (IEEE TIT 2024), for the entire range of the parameter k. Next, we devise a variant of the problem, the Quantum Padded Coupon Collector. We prove that its sample complexity matches that of the classical Coupon Collector problem for both modes of learning, thereby exhibiting the same asymptotic separation between proper and improper quantum learning as mentioned above. The techniques we develop in the process can be directly applied to any form of padded quantum data. We hope that padding can more generally lift other forms of classical learning behaviour to the quantum setting.},

abstract = {Can an adversary compromise the security of our system by obtaining information on sensitive data such as cryptographic keys through side-channels? Even worse, can an adversary hack into our computer and simply steal them? This question is almost as old as the Internet and significant effort has been spent on designing mechanisms to prevent and detect such attacks. Once quantum computers arrive, will the situation remain the same or can we hope to live in a better world? We first consider ubiquitous side-channel attacks, which aim to leak side information on secret system components, studied in the leakage-resilient cryptography literature. Classical leakage-resilient cryptography must necessarily impose restrictions on the type of leakage one aims to protect against. As a notable example, the most well-studied leakage model is that of bounded leakage, where it is assumed that an adversary learns at most L bits of leakage on secret components, for some leakage bound L. Although this leakage bound is necessary, many real-world side-channel attacks cannot be captured by bounded leakage. In this work, we design cryptographic schemes that provide guarantees against arbitrary side channel attacks: 
- Using techniques from unclonable quantum cryptography, we design several basic leakage- resilient primitives, such as public- and private-key encryption, (weak) pseudorandom functions, digital signatures and quantum money schemes which remain secure under (polynomially) unbounded classical leakage. In particular, this leakage can be much longer than the (quantum) secret being leaked upon. In our view, leakage is the result of observations of quantities such as power consumption and hence is most naturally viewed as classical information. Notably, the leakage-resilience of our schemes holds even in the stronger “LOCC leakage” model where the adversary can obtain adaptive leakage for unbounded number of rounds. - What if the adversary simply breaks into our system to steal our secret keys, rather than mounting only a side-channel attack?What if the adversary can even tamper with the data arbitrarily, for example to cover its tracks? We initiate the study of intrusion detection in the quantum setting, where one would like to detect if security has been compromised even in the face of an arbitrary intruder attack which can leak and tamper with classical as well as quantum data. We design cryptographic schemes supporting intrusion-detection for a host of primitives such as public- and private-key encryption, digital signature, functional encryption, program obfuscation and software protection. Our schemes are based on techniques from cryptography with secure key leasing and certified deletion.},

Combining several algorithmic techniques previously used for related problems, we propose an algorithm outperforming this result asymptotically and give rigorous bounds on its runtime. Our main techniques are the use of Araki expansionals, known from results on the nonexistence of phase transitions, and a matrix product operator construction. We also review a related approach using the Quantum Belief Propagation [Kuwahara et al., 2018], which in combination with our findings yields an equivalent result.},

abstract = {The solution of large systems of nonlinear differential equations is needed for many applications in science and engineering. In this study, we present three main improvements to existing quantum algorithms based on the Carleman linearisation technique. First, by using a high-precision technique for the solution of the linearised differential equations, we achieve logarithmic dependence of the complexity on the error and near-linear dependence on time. Second, we demonstrate that a rescaling technique can considerably reduce the cost, which would otherwise be exponential in the Carleman order for a system of ODEs, preventing a quantum speedup for PDEs. Third, we provide improved, tighter bounds on the error of Carleman linearisation. We apply our results to a class of discretised reaction-diffusion equations using higher-order finite differences for spatial resolution. We show that providing a stability criterion independent of the discretisation can conflict with the use of the rescaling due to the difference between the max-norm and 2-norm. An efficient solution may still be provided if the number of discretisation points is limited, as is possible when using higher-order discretisations.},

abstract = {The ability of quantum computers to directly manipulate and analyze quantum states stored in quantum memory allows them to learn about aspects of our physical world that would otherwise be invisible given a modest number of measurements. Here we investigate a new learning resource which could be available to quantum computers in the future – measurements on the unknown state accompanied by its complex conjugate ρ⊗ρ*. For a certain shadow tomography task, we surprisingly find that measurements on only copies of ρ⊗ρ* can be exponentially more powerful than measurements on ρ⊗K, even for large K. This expands the class of exponential advantages using only a constant overhead quantum memory, or minimal quantum memory, and we provide a number of examples where the state ρ* is naturally available in both computational and physical applications. In addition, we precisely quantify the power of classical shadows on single copies under a generalized Clifford ensemble and give a class of quantities that can be efficiently learned. The learning task we study in both the single copy and quantum memory is physically natural and corresponds to real-space observables with a limit of bosonic modes, where it achieves an exponential improvement in detecting certain signals under a noisy background. In addition to quantifying a fundamentally new and powerful resource in quantum learning, we believe the advantage may find applications in improving quantum simulation, learning from quantum sensors, and uncovering new physical phenomena.},

date = {2024-01-01},
abstract = {A recent line of work has shown the unconditional advantage of constant-depth quantum computation, or QNC0, over NC0, AC0, and related models of classical computation. Problems exhibiting this advantage include search and sampling tasks related to the parity function, and it is natural to ask whether QNC0 can be used to help compute parity itself. Namely, we study AC0◦QNC0—a hybrid circuit model where AC0 operates on measurement outcomes of a QNC0 circuit—and we ask whether Par ∈ AC0◦QNC0. We believe the answer is negative. In fact, we conjecture AC0◦QNC0 cannot even achieve Ω(1) correlation with parity. As evidence for this conjecture, we prove the following: • When the QNC0 circuit is ancilla-free, we show this model can achieve only negligible correlation with parity, even when AC0 is replaced with any function having LMN-like decay in its Fourier spectrum. • For the general (non-ancilla-free) case, we show via a connection to nonlocal games that the conjecture holds for any class of postprocessing functions that has approximate degree o(n) and is closed under restrictions. Moreover, this is true even when the QNC0 circuit is given arbitrary quantum advice. By known results, this conﬁrms the conjecture for linear-size AC0 circuits. • Another approach to proving the conjecture is to show a switching lemma for AC0◦QNC0. Towards this goal, we study the effect of quantum preprocessing on the decision tree complexity of Boolean functions. We ﬁnd that from the point of view of a decision tree, nonlocal channels are no better than randomness: a Boolean function f precomposed with an n-party nonlocal channel is together equal to a randomized decision tree with depth no greater than DTdepth[f]. Taken together, our results suggest that while QNC0 is surprisingly powerful for search and sampling, that power is “locked away” in the global correlations of its output, inaccessible to simple classical computation for solving decision problems.},

On the other hand, we prove that, in general, it is impossible for any quantum algorithm to achieve quadratic speed-up over the number of classical samples needed to estimate the mean μ, where the samples come from different random variables with mean close to μ. Technically, our quantum algorithms reduce bounded and sub-Gaussian random variables to the Bernoulli case, and use an uncomputation trick to overcome the challenge that direct amplitude estimation does not work with non-identical query access. Our quantum query lower bounds are established by simulating non-identical oracles by parallel oracles, and also by an adversarial method with non-identical oracles. Both results pave the way for proving quantum query lower bounds with non-identical oracles in general, which may be of independent interest.},

We consider in particular two classes of guiding states: those that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum circuit; and those belonging to a class of quantum states we call classically evaluatable, for which it is possible to efficiently compute expectation values of local observables classically. We show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for both classes of guiding states are 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠-complete in the inverse-polynomial precision setting, but lie within 𝖭𝖯 (or 𝖭𝗊𝖯) in the constant precision regime when the guiding state is classically evaluatable. Our completeness results show that, from a complexity-theoretic perspective, classical Ansätze selected by classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum Ansätze prepared by quantum heuristics, as long as one has access to quantum phase estimation. In relation to the quantum PCP conjecture, we (i) define a complexity class capturing quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proof systems and show that it is contained in BQP^NP[1] for constant proof queries; (ii) give a no-go result on 'dequantizing' the known quantum reduction which maps a 𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖯-verification circuit to a local Hamiltonian with constant promise gap; (iii) give several no-go results for the existence of quantum gap amplification procedures that preserve certain ground state properties; and (iv) propose two conjectures that can be viewed as stronger versions of the NLTS theorem.

It is known though that the adversary method, in its general negative-weighted version, is tight for bounded-error quantum algorithms, whereas the polynomial method is not. By the tightness of the former, for any polynomial lower bound, there ought to exist a corresponding adversary lower bound. However, direct reduction was not known. In this paper, we give a simple and direct reduction from the polynomial method (in the form of a dual polynomial) to the adversary method.

We show the following results: (I) unknown n-qubit degree-d (in the Pauli basis) quantum channels and unitaries can be learned using O(1/ε^d) queries (which is independent of n), (II) polynomials p:-1,1^n -&gt; [-1,1] arising from d-query quantum algorithms can be learned from O((1/ε)^d log n) many random examples (x,p(x)) (which implies learnability even for d=O(log n)), and (III) degree-d polynomials p:-1,1^n -&gt; [-1,1] can be learned through O(1/ε^d) queries to a quantum unitary Up that block-encodes p. Our main technical contributions are new Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities for quantum channels and completely bounded polynomials.},

abstract = {We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay super-exponentially, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sub-logarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.},

The n-rotor Clifford group, U(1)n(n+1)/2 ⋊ GLn(Z), is represented by continuous U(1) gates generated by polynomials quadratic in angular momenta, as well as discrete GLn(Z) gates generated by momentum sign-flip and sum gates. Understandings in rotor 
Clifford group allow us to establish connections between homological rotor error-correcting codes and oscillator quantum codes, including Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes and rotation-symmetric bosonic codes. Inspired by homological rotor codes, we provide a systematic construction of multi-mode rotation-symmetric bosonic codes by analoging Fock states to rotor states with non-negative angular momentum. This new family of multi-mode bosonic codes protect against dephasing and changes in occupation numbers, which we call homological number-phase codes. Their encoding and decoding circuits are readily derived from the corresponding 
rotor Clifford operations. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post-selection. We also outline several 
rotor and oscillator varieties of the GKP-stabilizer codes.

abstract = {Most security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) disregard the effect of information leakage from the users’ devices, and, thus, do not protect against Trojan-horse attacks (THAs). In a THA, the eavesdropper injects strong light into the QKD apparatuses, and then analyzes the back-reflected light to learn information about their internal setting choices. Only a few works consider this security threat but predict a rather poor performance of QKD unless the devices are strongly isolated from the channel. Here, we derive finite-key security bounds for decoy-state-based QKD schemes in the presence of THAs, which significantly outperform previous analyses.},

The data that we observe in nature from various physical phenomena can be modelled using quantum circuits. We present a hybrid approach to loading probability distributions by performing de-convolution as a pre-processing step before the quantum circuit. To quantify the closeness of the distribution of outcomes from the hybrid classical-quantum block and the target distribution, we use the Jensen-Shannon distance as the cost function. The chosen cost function allows us to improve the deconvolution step before the use of quantum circuits. We test the algorithm on IBM Quantum simulators and IBMQ Kolkata, a 27-qubit quantum processor, and validate the results.},

abstract = {Continuous Variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising candidate for practical implementations due to its compatibility with the existing communication technology. A trusted device scenario assuming that an adversary has no access to imperfections such as electronic noises in the detector is expected to provide significant improvement in the key rate, but such an endeavor so far was made separately for specific protocols and for specific proof techniques. Here, we develop a simple and general treatment that can incorporate the effects of Gaussian trusted noises for any protocol that uses homodyne/heterodyne measurements. In our method, a rescaling of the outcome of a noisy homodyne/heterodyne detector renders it equivalent to the outcome of a noiseless detector with a tiny additional loss, thanks to a noise-loss equivalence well-known in quantum optics. Since this method is independent of protocols and security proofs, it is applicable to Gaussian-modulation and discrete-modulation protocols, to the finite-size regime, and to any proof techniques developed so far and yet to be discovered as well.},

abstract = {Several physically inspired problems have been proven undecidable; examples are the spectral gap problem and the membership problem for quantum correlations. Most of these results rely on reductions from a handful of undecidable problems, such as the halting problem, the tiling problem, the Post correspondence problem or the matrix mortality problem. All these problems have a common property: they have an NP-hard bounded version. This work establishes a relation between undecidable unbounded problems and their bounded NP-hard versions. Specifically, we show that NP-hardness of a bounded version follows easily from the reduction of the unbounded problems. This leads to new and simpler proofs of the NP-hardness of bounded version of the Post correspondence problem, the matrix mortality problem, the positivity of matrix product operators, the reachability problem, the tiling problem, and the ground state energy problem. This work sheds light on the intractability of problems in theoretical physics and on the computational consequences of bounding a parameter.},

In this work, we introduce a coherence-based semi-quantum, semi-device-independent, quantum key distribution protocol where users only need to implement classical operations i.e. fixed basis detections, and prove its security in the bounded quantum storage model. The protocol is based on the noise-robust version of a coherence equality game that witnesses different types of coherence.},

Our result shows that for any two qubit pure bipartite state, the interference visibility is a direct measure of entanglement. We also propose how to measure the mutual predictability experimentally from the intensity patterns of the interferometric set-up without having to resort to local measurements of mutually unbiased bases. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement witness operator can be measured in a interference setup and the phase shift is sensitive to the separable or entangled nature of the state. Our proposal bring out the power of Interferometric set-up in entanglement detection of pure and several mixed states which paves the way towards design of entanglement meter.},

The learner has the goal of maximizing the reward in each round, that is the outcome of the measurement on the unknown state. Using this model we formulate the low energy quantum state recommendation problem where the context is a Hamiltonian and the goal is to recommend the state with the lowest energy. For this task, we study two families of contexts: the Ising model and a generalized cluster model. We observe that if we interpret the actions as different phases of the models then the recommendation is done by classifying the correct phase of the given Hamiltonian and the strategy can be interpreted as an online quantum phase classifier.},

abstract = {I'll present some recent work on an intimate link between two a priori distinct phenomena: quantum nonlocality without entanglement and classically-achievable indefinite causal order. The first phenomenon refers to a multipartite scenario where the parties are unable to perfectly discriminate orthogonal product states drawn from an ensemble of quantum states by using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The second (hypothetical) phenomenon refers to a multipartite scenario where the parties can communicate classically but the local operations of each party are in the future of the other parties, i.e., they cannot be ordered causally. Specifically, we show how three separated parties with access to a classical process exhibiting indefinite causal order—the AF/BW process—can perfectly discriminate the states in an ensemble—the SHIFT ensemble—that exhibits quantum nonlocality without entanglement. I will also mention a generalisation of this result beyond the tripartite case and comment on its connection with separable operations that are outside LOCC.

ADAPT-VQE, an adaptive and problem-tailored variant, is a promising option for building accurate and compact ansätze. In this work, we use the $latex H_2$ molecule to assess the impact of noise on the error and shot requirements of this algorithm relative to UCCSD-VQE, a static alternative. Additionally, we introduce three novel operator pools that allow us to analyze the importance of symmetry preservation in ADAPT-VQE. Finally, we propose a strategy for reducing the depth of the ADAPT ansatz by removing operators on the fly. Our conclusions are three-fold: (i) a shot count reduction stemming from the compactness of the ADAPT ansatz alleviates the measurement overhead predicted from a noise-free analysis, (ii) symmetry preservation is the key aspect promoting convergence in fermion-inspired pools and (iii) a frugal operator removal protocol often allows us to obtain shallower circuits in exchange for a small cost overhead.},

The smallest such $n$ is termed the degree of $f$. Near-idempotents can be viewed as a generalisation of idempotents, as the latter is just near-idempotents of degree 1. While theories of near-idempotents were well-established in ring theory, general frameworks of constructing codes using near-idempotents remain rather unexplored. Therefore, this session is devoted to exploring classes of quantum stabilizer codes and their properties, which near-idempotents are served as the generator of their underlying additive codes over $mathbbF_4$. This is primarily done by adopting a perspective of viewing codes over $mathbbF_4$ isomorphically as group algebras over the same finite field. Via the lens of group algebras, we characterize conditions on near-idempotents that enables their additive codes to sufficiently satisfies the inner product criterion for stabilizer formalism, then characterizes the constructed codes and some of their properties. Our results shows that a number of quantum codes generated by near-idempotents coincide with the best known parameters.},

abstract = {We study the counting version of the Boolean satisfiability problem sSAT using the ZH-calculus, a graphical language originally introduced to reason about quantum circuits. Using this we find a natural extension of #SAT which we call #SAT_±, where variables are additionally labelled by phases, which is GapP-complete. Using graphical reasoning, we find a reduction from #SAT to #2SAT_± in the ZH-calculus. We observe that the DPLL algorithm for #2SAT can be adapted to #2SAT_± directly and hence that Wahlstrom's $O^*(1.2377^n)$ upper bound applies to #2SAT_± as well. Combining this with our reduction from #SAT to #2SAT_± gives us novel upper bounds in terms of clauses and variables that are better than $O^*(2^n)$ for small clause densities of $fracmn &lt; 2.25$. This is to our knowledge the first non-trivial upper bound for #SAT that is independent of clause size. Our algorithm improves on Dubois' upper bound for #kSAT whenever $fracmn &lt; 1.85$ and $k geq 4$, and the Williams' average-case analysis whenever $fracmn &lt; 1.21$ and $k geq 6$. We also obtain an upper bound of $O^*(1.1740^L)$ for $sSAT$ in terms of the length of the formula, and find an improved bound on $#textbf3SAT$ for $1.2577 &lt; fracmn łeq frac73$. Our results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmic insights, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus was intended for. In addition, using the connection to counting problems, we find a new classical simulation algorithm for quantum computations that runs in $O(1.38^g)$ where g is the number of gates.},

abstract = {Decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD) is undoubtedly the most efficient solution to han- dle multi-photon signals emitted by laser sources, and provides the same secret key rate scaling as ideal single-photon sources. It requires, however, that the phase of each emitted pulse is uniformly random. This might be difficult to guarantee in practice, due to inevitable device imperfections and/or the use of an external phase modulator for phase randomization, which limits the possible selected phases to a finite set. Here, we investigate the security of decoy-state QKD with arbitrary, continuous or discrete, non-uniform phase randomization, and show that this technique is quite robust to deviations from the ideal uniformly random scenario. For this, we combine a novel param- eter estimation technique based on semi-definite programming, with the use of basis mismatched events, to tightly estimate the parameters that determine the achievable secret key rate. In doing so, we demonstrate that our analysis can significantly outperform previous results that address more restricted scenarios.},

abstract = {When it is a matter of optimally solving a mathematical optimization problem, quantum optimization has in principle a theoretical advantage over classical optimization. In particular, Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are well suited for quantum solvers, since they are equivalent to an Ising spin model. In order to map a generic combinatorial optimization problem to a QUBO, however, removing the constraints requires selecting a penalty coefficient known in the classical community as "big-M". We show how the problem of selecting a suitable big-M value is daunting when employing quantum solvers as well, while we propose a novel approach to compute an efficient value of it, in order to have a QUBO formulation which is easier to solve. We finally benchmark the proposed method on toy generic instances and on Portfolio Optimization instances, both with simulations and on quantum hardware, showing a clear advantage when using the proposed technique.},

abstract = {The design of quantum protocols for secure key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand, they need to be practical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks.},

or coherent (quantum amplitude amplification) but with circuit depths and ancillary-qubit numbers unrealistically large in the mid-term. Our main contribution is a new generation of deterministic, high-precision QITE algorithms that are significantly more amenable experimentally. These are based on a surprisingly simple idea: partitioning the evolution into several fragments that are sequentially run probabilistically. This causes a huge reduction in wasted circuit depth every time a run fails. Indeed, the resulting overall runtime is asymptotically better than in coherent approaches, and the hardware requirements are comparable to probabilistic ones. Our findings are especially relevant for the early fault-tolerance stages of quantum hardware.},

We investigate these differences, and as one of our main results show that if the reference strategy of a given game has full Schmidt rank, the notions of self-testing strategies using either mixed or pure states coincide. Additionally, we show by example that not all types of self-testing statements are equivalent: We both provide an example of a nonlocal game which is an exact, but not a robust, self-test, and an example of another game which does not self-test any state.},

abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a general purpose quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization. We analyze its expected performance and prove concentration properties at any constant level (number of layers) on ensembles of random combinatorial optimization problems in the infinite size limit. These ensembles include mixed spin models and Max-q-XORSAT on sparse random hypergraphs. Our analysis can be understood via a saddle-point approximation of a sum-over-paths integral. This is made rigorous by proving a generalization of the multinomial theorem, which is a technical result of independent interest. We then show that the performance of the QAOA at constant levels for the pure q-spin model matches asymptotically the ones for Max-q-XORSAT on random sparse Erdos-Renyi hypergraphs and every large-girth regular hypergraph. Through this correspondence, we establish that the average-case value produced by the QAOA at constant levels is bounded away from optimality for pure q-spin models when q &gt;= 4 and is even. This limitation gives a hardness of approximation result for quantum algorithms in a new regime where the whole graph is seen.},

Importantly, we provide two concrete realizations with superconducting circuits, analyzing their performance both from the analytical and numerical perspective. Our results provide a breakthrough shift in the current architecture paradigm.

abstract = {The so-called welded tree problem provides an example of a black-box problem that can be solved exponentially faster by a quantum walk than by any classical algorithm. Given the name of a special ENTRANCE vertex, a quantum walk can find another distinguished EXIT vertex using polynomially many queries, though without finding any particular path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior. Our no-go result suggests that, for some problems, quantum algorithms must necessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to outperform classical computation.},

abstract = {Storing quantum information in a quantum error correction code can protect it from errors, but the ability to transform the stored quantum information in a fault tolerant way is equally important. 
Logical Pauli group operators can be implemented on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a commonly-studied category of codes, by applying a series of physical Pauli X and Z gates. Logical operators of this form are fault-tolerant because each qubit is acted upon by at most one gate, limiting the spread of errors, and are referred to as transversal logical operators. Identifying transversal logical operators outside the Pauli group is less well understood. Pauli operators are the first level of the Clifford hierarchy which is deeply connected to fault-tolerance and universality. 
In this work, we study transversal logical operators composed of single- and multi-qubit diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates. We demonstrate algorithms for identifying all transversal diagonal logical operators on a CSS code that are more general or have lower computational complexity than previous methods. We also show a method for constructing CSS codes that have a desired diagonal logical Clifford hierarchy operator implemented using single qubit phase gates. Our methods rely on representing operators composed of diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates as diagonal XP operators and this technique may have broader applications.},

abstract = {Accurate information processing is crucial both in technology and in nature. To achieve it, any information processing system needs an initial supply of resources away from thermal equilibrium. Here we establish a fundamental limit on the accuracy achievable with a given amount of nonequilibrium resources. The limit applies to arbitrary information processing tasks and arbitrary information processing systems subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. It is easily computable and is expressed in terms of an entropic quantity, which we name the reverse entropy, associated to a time reversal of the information processing task under consideration. The limit is achievable for all deterministic classical computations and for all their quantum extensions. As an application, we establish the optimal tradeoff between nonequilibrium and accuracy for the fundamental tasks of storing, transmitting, cloning, and erasing information. Our results set a target for the design of new devices approaching the ultimate efficiency limit, and provide a framework for demonstrating thermodynamical advantages of quantum devices over their classical counterparts. This also implies a thermodynamic benchmark to certify genuine quantum devices from their classical simulation.},

abstract = {We present a classical algorithm capable of estimating Born rule probabilities of quantum circuits consisting of matchgate/Fermionic linear optical (FLO) unitaries and non-FLO controlled-phase gates with arbitrary phases. Our algorithm has asymptotic runtime linear in an (in general) exponentially large quantity we have named the “FLO-extent”, and is at most polynomial all other parameters. The FLO-extent is defined in a similar way to the stabilizer extent known from the literature on quantum simulation using stabilizer decompositions. The FLO extent is sub-multiplicative, and the multiplicative upper bound leads to a runtime for our algorithm which doubles for each swap gate, or controlled-Z gate added to the circuit. Controlled-phase gates with different phases have lower extent, smoothly interpolating between 1 and 2. These numbers can be compared with the prior state of-the-art for this task, the runtime of which is multiplied by a factor 9 for each CZ-gate. This dramatic difference in performance is due to our use of methods we have developed to perform tasks in the FLO subtheory in a phase-sensitive way, allowing us to decompose the relevant “magic states” at the level of statevectors rather than density operators. Our results are formulated for quantum circuits, directly extending the class of quantum computations that can be simulated using current classical computers. However, the FLO subtheory also naturally represents the evolution of non-interacting Fermions, while the addition of non-FLO unitaries to the circuit can represent interactions between Fermions. We therefore expect that our results will be applicable to classical simulations of weakly interacting Fermions, with potential applications in condensed matter and quantum chemistry research. In addition to practical simulation our work is part of the ongoing effort to understand the differences between the computational power of classical and that of quantum mechanics. By extending classical simulation methods to new areas we can focus attention on those features of quantum computations which are necessary for meaningful "quantum advantage".},

abstract = {Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication primitive that allows a long-distance quantum channel to be built using pre-shared entanglement and one-way classical communication. However, the quality of the established channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In this work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of teleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state discrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding protocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success probability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in one-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover, our established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to show that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage for dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication capacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible information of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple proof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not provide any advantage in dense coding.},

In this work, we prove the first out-of-distribution generalization guarantees in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on testing data drawn from a distribution different from the training data distribution. Namely, we establish out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary using a quantum neural network and for a broad class of training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training data. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the near-term prospects of QML for learning quantum dynamics, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits. Based on these insights, we propose a QML-based algorithm for simulating quantum dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and rigorously prove its resource-efficiency in terms of qubit and training data requirements. We also demonstrate the viability of this algorithm through numerical experiments, both in classical simulations and on quantum hardware. Finally, we embed this algorithm in a broader framework for using QML methods for quantum dynamical simulation on NISQ devices.},

A famous example of this radical departure—this nonclassicality—is entanglement. Bell's theorem shows that shared entanglement can be used to generate correlations between non-communicating parties in ways that are impossible to do without communication if one only had access to classical shared randomness. In their very formulation, both entanglement and Bell's theorem are composite notions of nonclassicality, i.e., they require at least two parties to be meaningful. Another key notion of nonclassicality is contextuality that follows from the Kochen-Specker theorem: this notion is applicable to single systems. I will present some recent results on the interplay between contextuality and entanglement in composite systems and their consequences for our understanding of restricted models of multiqubit quantum computation with state injection that have been previously proposed.

In particular, we propose and analyze a more practically-implementable variant of the protocol, thrifty shadow estimation, in which quantum circuits are reused many times instead of having to be freshly generated for each measurement (as in the original protocol). We show that the effect of this reuse strongly depends on the family of quantum circuits that is chosen. In particular, it is maximally effective when sampling Haar random unitaries, and maximally ineffective when sampling Clifford circuits (even though the Clifford group forms a three-design). To interpolate between these two extremes, we provide an efficiently simulable family of quantum circuits inspired by a recent construction of approximate t-designs. Finally we consider tail bounds for shadow estimation and discuss when median-of-means estimation can be replaced with standard mean estimation.},

abstract = {Approximation based on perturbation theory is the foundation for most of the quantitative predictions of quantum mechanics, whether in quantum many-body physics, chemistry, or other domains. Quantum computing provides an alternative to the perturbation paradigm, yet current quantum processors with few noisy qubits are of limited practical utility. In this talk, we introduce perturbative quantum simulation, which combines the complementary strengths of the two approaches, enabling the solution of large quantum problems using limited intermediate-scale quantum hardware. The use of a quantum processor alleviates the need to identify a solvable unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the introduction of perturbative coupling permits a quantum processor to simulate systems with larger sizes. We present an explicit perturbative expansion that mimics the Dyson series expansion and involves only local unitary operations. We then discuss its optimality over other expansions under certain conditions. This perturbative approach is benchmarked by simulating the interacting dynamics of representative quantum systems.},

abstract = {Arguably, the largest class of stochastic processes generated by means of a finite memory consists of those that are sequences of observations produced by sequential measurements in a suitable generalized probabilistic theory (GPT). These are constructed from a finite-dimensional memory evolving under a set of possible linear maps, and with probabilities of outcomes determined by linear functions of the memory state. Examples of such models are given by classical hidden Markov processes, where the memory state is a probability distribution, and at each step it evolves according to a non-negative matrix, and hidden quantum Markov processes, where the memory state is a finite dimensional quantum state, and at each step it evolves according to a completely positive map. Here we show that the set of processes admitting a finite-dimensional explanation do not need to be explainable in terms of either classical probability or quantum mechanics. To wit, we exhibit families of processes that have a finite-dimensional explanation, defined manifestly by the dynamics of explicitly given GPT, but that do not admit a quantum, and therefore not even classical, explanation in finite dimension. Furthermore, we present a family of quantum processes on qubits and qutrits that do not admit a classical finite-dimensional realization, which includes examples introduced earlier by Fox, Rubin, Dharmadikari and Nadkarni as functions of infinite dimensional Markov chains, and lower bound the size of the memory of a classical model realizing a noisy version of the qubit processes.},

abstract = {Entanglement detection is essential in quantum information science and quantum many-body physics. It has been proved that entanglement exists almost surely for a random quantum state, while the realizations of effective entanglement criteria usually consume exponential resources, and efficient criteria often perform poorly without prior knowledge. This fact implies a fundamental limitation might exist in the detectability of entanglement. In this work, we formalize this limitation as a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness of entanglement criteria via a systematic method to theoretically evaluate the detection capability of entanglement criteria. For a system coupled to an environment, we prove that any entanglement criterion needs exponentially many observables to detect the entanglement effectively when restricted to single-copy operations. Otherwise, the detection capability of the criterion will decay double-exponentially. Furthermore, if multi-copy joint measurements are allowed, the effectiveness of entanglement detection can be exponentially improved, which implies a quantum advantage in entanglement detection problems.},

XOR games have been widely studied in the literature of nonlocal games, and we introduce XOR* games as their natural counterpart within the class of games where a resource system is subjected to a sequence of controlled operations and a final measurement. Examples of XOR* games are 2→1 quantum random access codes (QRAC) and the CHSH* game introduced by Henaut et al. in [PRA 98,060302(2018)]. We prove, using the diagrammatic language of process theories, that under certain assumptions these two classes of games can be related via an explicit theorem that connects their optimal strategies, and so their classical (Bell) and quantum (Tsirelson) bounds. One main assumption in the theorem is that the sequential transformations in the XOR* games are reversible. However, this does not affect the generality of the theorem in terms of assessing the maximum quantum-over-classical advantage, since we also show that the use of irreversible transformations cannot enhance such advantage. We conclude with several examples of pairs of XOR/XOR* games and by discussing in detail the possible resources that power the quantum computational advantages in XOR* games.},

This paper studies this concept from the viewpoint of quantum distributed computing, and especially distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur (dQMA) protocols. We first introduce a novel task, on a line, called state generation with distributed inputs (SGDI). In this task, the goal is to generate the quantum state $Uketpsi$ at the rightmost node of the line, where $ketpsi$ is a quantum state given at the leftmost node and $U$ is an unitary matrix whose description is distributed over the nodes of the line. We give a dQMA protocol for SGDI and utilize this protocol to construct a dQMA protocol for the Set Equality problem studied by Naor, Parter and Yogev [SODA 2020], and complement our protocol by showing classical lower bounds for this problem. Our second contribution is a dQMA protocol, based on a recent work by Zhu and Hayashi [Physical Review A, 2019], to create EPR-pairs between adjacent nodes of a network without quantum communication. As an application of this dQMA protocol, we prove a general result showing how to convert any dQMA protocol on an arbitrary network into another dQMA protocol where the verification stage does not require any quantum communication.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the full quantum state of a many-body system requires the estimation of a number of parameters that grows exponentially with system size. Nevertheless, there are situations in which one is only interested in a subset of these parameters and a full reconstruction is not needed. A paradigmatic example is a scenario where one aims at determining all the reduced states only up to a given size. Overlapping tomography provides constructions to address this problem with a number of product measurements much smaller than what is obtained when performing independent tomography of each reduced state. There are however many relevant physical systems with a natural notion of locality where one is mostly interested in the reduced states of neighboring particles. In this work, we study this form of local overlapping tomography. First of all, we show that, contrary to its full version, the number of product-measurement settings needed for local overlapping tomography does not grow with system size. Then, we present strategies for qubit and fermionic systems in selected lattice geometries. The developed methods find a natural application in the estimation of many-body systems prepared in current quantum simulators or quantum computing devices, where interactions are often local.},

abstract = {The Clifford+T gate set is commonly used to perform universal quantum computation. In such setup the T gate is typically much more expensive to implement in a fault-tolerant way than Clifford gates. To improve the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computing it is then crucial to minimize the number of T gates. Many algorithms, yielding effective results, have been designed to address this problem. It has been demonstrated that performing a pre-processing step consisting of reducing the number of Hadamard gates in the circuit can help to exploit the full potential of these algorithms and thereby lead to a substantial T-count reduction. Moreover, minimizing the number of Hadamard gates also restrains the number of additional qubits and operations resulting from the gadgetization of Hadamard gates, a procedure used by some compilers to further reduce the number of T gates. In this work we tackle the Hadamard gate reduction problem, and propose an algorithm for synthesizing a sequence of Pauli rotations with a minimal number of Hadamard gates. Based on this result, we present an algorithm which optimally minimizes the number of Hadamard gates lying between the first and the last T gate of the circuit.},

Our proofs use polynomial approximations to show that these states are close to local operators. This implies that the distribution of the Hamming weight of a computational basis measurement (and of other related observables) concentrates. An example of (iii) are the states produced by the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA). Using our concentration results for these states, we show that for a random spin model, the QAOA can only succeed with negligible probability even at super-constant level $p = o(łog łog n)$, assuming a strengthened version of the so-called overlap gap property. This gives the first limitations on the QAOA on dense instances at super-constant level.},

We further show that already for classical channels this upper bound can sometimes be achieved and be strictly larger than what is possible with parallel strategies. Hence, there can be an advantage of adaptive channel discrimination strategies with composite hypotheses for classical channels, unlike in the case of simple hypotheses. Moreover, we show that classically this advantage can only exist if the sets of channels corresponding to the hypotheses are non-convex. As a consequence of our more general treatment, which is not limited to the composite i.i.d. setting, we also obtain a generalization of previous composite state discrimination results.},

abstract = {The two-way capacities of quantum channels determine the ultimate entanglement and secret-key distribution rates achievable by two distant parties that are connected by a noisy transmission line, in absence of quantum repeaters. Since repeaters will likely be expensive to build and maintain, a central open problem of quantum communication is to understand what performances are achievable without them. In this paper, we find a new lower bound on the energy-constrained and unconstrained two-way quantum and secret-key capacities of all phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels, namely thermal attenuator, thermal amplifier, and additive Gaussian noise, which are realistic models for the noise affecting optical fibres or free-space links. Ours is the first nonzero lower bound on the two-way quantum capacity in the parameter range where the (reverse) coherent information becomes negative, and it shows explicitly that entanglement distribution is always possible when the channel is not entanglement breaking. This completely solves a crucial open problem of the field, namely, establishing the maximum excess noise which is tolerable in continuous-variable quantum key distribution. In addition, our construction is fully explicit, i.e.~we devise and optimise a concrete entanglement distribution and distillation protocol that works by combining recurrence and hashing protocols.},

abstract = {The process matrix framework models quantum protocols without assuming a definite acyclic causal order between the operations of parties in the protocol. This leads to so-called indefinite causal order processes which have been shown to provide advantages for quantum information processing. However, there have been longstanding open questions regarding the subset of practically realisable process matrices, as well as challenges in formulating their composition. We make progress on addressing such questions by connecting an important subset of process matrices, namely quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC) with so-called causal boxes which describe practical quantum information protocols in spacetime. Causal boxes are fully closed under composition and incorporate physical principles such as relativistic causality in spacetime. We first identify a notion of operational equivalence between QC-QCs and causal boxes by connecting state spaces and operations in the two formalisms. We then explicitly construct for each QC-QC an operationally equivalent causal box that satisfies certain special mathematical properties that allows the causal box to be interpreted as a process, this corresponds to a subset of causal boxes previously known as process boxes. This allows us to define composition of QC-QCs in terms of composition of causal boxes which is well-defined. We conjecture with a proof sketch that the spatiotemporal labels involved in their description can be simplified to a certain totally ordered form. Based on this, we establish through a constructive proof that every process box can be mapped to an operationally equivalent QCQC. This indicates that the subset of indefinite causal order processes realisable in a background spacetime correspond to controlled superpositions of acyclic orders, which in particular rules out processes violating so-called causal inequalities. Our results shed light on the practicality and composability questions for indefinite causal structures while introducing new physically-motivated tools for studying their applications for quantum information processing in spacetime.},

abstract = {We study an elementary Markov process on graphs based on electric flow sampling (elfs). The elfs process repeatedly samples from an electric flow on a graph. While the sinks of the flow are fixed, the source is updated using the electric flow sample, and the process ends when it hits a sink vertex. 
We argue that this process naturally connects to many key quantities of interest. E.g., we describe a random walk coupling which implies that the elfs process has the same arrival distribution as a random walk. We also analyze the electric hitting time, which is the expected time before the process hits a sink vertex. As our main technical contribution, we show that the electric hitting time on trees is logarithmic in the graph size and weights. The initial motivation behind the elfs process is that quantum walks can sample from electric flows, and they can hence implement this process very naturally. This yields a quantum walk algorithm for sampling from the random walk arrival distribution, which has widespread applications. It complements the existing line of quantum walk search algorithms which only return an element from the sink, but yield no insight in the distribution of the returned element. By our bound on the electric hitting time on trees, the quantum walk algorithm on trees requires quadratically fewer steps than the random walk hitting time, up to polylog factors.},

A well-known issue in benchmarking is that not everything about quantum noise is learnable due to the existence of gauge freedom, leaving open the question of what information about noise is learnable and what is not, which has been unclear even for a single CNOT gate. Here we give a precise characterization of the learnability of Pauli noise channels attached to Clifford gates, showing that learnable information corresponds to the cycle space of the pattern transfer graph of the gate set, while unlearnable information corresponds to the cut space. This implies the optimality of cycle benchmarking, in the sense that it can learn all learnable information about Pauli noise. We experimentally demonstrate noise characterization of IBM's CNOT gate up to 2 unlearnable degrees of freedom, for which we obtain bounds using physical constraints. In addition, we give an attempt to characterize the unlearnable information by assuming perfect initial state preparation. However, based on the experimental data, we conclude that this assumption is inaccurate as it yields unphysical estimates, and we obtain a lower bound on state preparation noise.},

abstract = {The task of testing the validity of a hypothesis underlies numerous applications in quantum information theory. The most commonly investigated approach is that of gathering all the available (quantum) data and making a final decision based on a collective measurement. However, such offline strategies are often far from practical, both in the amount of data required as well as in the complexity of the required measurement. In some settings, when the goal is quick detection, offline algorithms are not applicable at all, as they can only make a decision once all samples are received. Sequential methods offer the use of online strategies, where samples are requested on a need-to-know basis, drastically reducing the number of required samples in order to guarantee the, task specific, associated performance criteria. While extensively investigated and applied in the classical setting, we know far less about the optimal performance of such online strategies when quantum data is available. In this joint submission we present major recent progress on sequential methods for the fundamental tasks of quantum state discrimination, channel discrimination and quickest change point detection. In summary, we provide a comprehensive picture of the optimal asymptotic performance of online strategies in these settings under different performance criteria.},

abstract = {By no fast-forwarding theorem, the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be $Ør(|H| t)$, which essentially states that one can not go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant $h łl 1$), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is $Ør(h^-1)$. We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be $Ør(1)$, that is, to simulate some observables of the Schrödinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds [Lasser-Lubich 2020] to uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for semiclassical Schr"odinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, of the underlying dynamics and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.},

Operating under the assumption that entangled states with zero distillable key do not exist, we define the key cost of a quantum state, channel, and device. We study its properties through the lens of a quantity that we call the key of formation. The main result of our paper is that the regularized key of formation equals the key cost of a quantum state. The core protocol underlying this result is privacy dilution, which converts states containing ideal privacy into ones with diluted privacy. Additionally, our main result follows by proving that the key of formation is an entanglement monotone with appealing mathematical properties. We further focus on mixed-state analogues of pure quantum states in the domain of privacy, and we prove that a number of entanglement measures are equal to each other for these states, similar to the case of pure entangled states. The privacy cost in the single-shot regime exhibits a yield-cost relation, and basic results for quantum channels and devices are also provided.},

We discuss two implications. First, our bound implies that the lowest energy density obtainable from a large class of existing variational circuits (e.g., Hamiltonian variational ansatz) cannot, in general, decay exponentially with the circuit depth. Second, if long-range entanglement is present in the ground state, this can lead to a nontrivial circuit-depth lower bound even at nonzero energy density. Unlike previous approaches to prove circuit-depth lower bounds for preparing low energy states, our proof technique does not rely on the ground state to be degenerate.},

abstract = {We show that a quantum spin system has an exact description by noninteracting fermions if its frustration graph is claw-free and contains a simplicial clique. The frustration graph of a spin model captures the pairwise anticommutation relations between Pauli terms of its Hamiltonian in a given basis. This result captures a vast family of known free-fermion solutions. In previous work, it was shown that a free-fermion solution exists if the frustration graph is either a line graph, or (even-hole, claw)-free. The former case generalizes the celebrated Jordan-Wigner transformation and includes the exact solution to the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter case generalizes a nonlocal solution to the four-fermion model given by Fendley. Our characterization unifies these two approaches, extending generalized Jordan-Wigner solutions to the nonlocal setting and generalizing the four-fermion solution to models of arbitrary spatial dimension. Our key technical insight is the identification of a class of cycle symmetries for all models with claw-free frustration graphs. We prove that these symmetries commute, and this allows us to apply Fendley's solution method to each symmetric subspace independently. Finally, we give a physical description of the fermion modes in terms of operators generated by repeated commutation with the Hamiltonian. This connects our framework to the developing body of work on operator Krylov subspaces. Our results deepen the existing connection between many-body physics and the mathematical theory of claw-free graphs.},

However, the non-classical resources enabling such computational advantages are challenging to pinpoint, as it is not a single resource but the subtle interplay of many that can be held responsible for these potential advantages. In this work, we show that every bosonic quantum computation can be recast into a continuous-variable sampling computation where all computational resources are contained in the input state. Using this reduction, we derive a general classical algorithm for the strong simulation of bosonic computations, whose complexity scales with the non-Gaussian stellar rank of both the input state and the measurement setup. We further study the conditions for an efficient classical simulation of the associated continuous-variable sampling computations and identify an operational notion of non-Gaussian entanglement based on the lack of passive separability, thus clarifying the interplay of bosonic quantum computational resources such as squeezing, non-Gaussianity and entanglement.},

abstract = {Although a concept class may be learnt more efficiently using quantum samples as compared with classical samples in certain scenarios, Arunachalam and de Wolf (JMLR, 2018) proved that quantum learners are asymptotically no more efficient than classical ones in the quantum PAC and Agnostic learning models. They established lower bounds on sample complexity via quantum state identification and Fourier analysis. In this paper, we derive optimal lower bounds for quantum sample complexity in both the PAC and agnostic models via an information-theoretic approach. The proofs are arguably simpler, and the same ideas can potentially be used to derive optimal bounds for other problems in quantum learning theory. We then turn to a quantum analogue of the Coupon Collector problem, a classic problem from probability theory also of importance in the study of PAC learning. Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC, 2020) characterized the quantum sample complexity of this problem up to constant factors. First, we show that the information-theoretic approach mentioned above provably does not yield the optimal lower bound. As a by-product, we get a natural ensemble of pure states in arbitrarily high dimensions which are not easily (simultaneously) distinguishable, while the ensemble has close to maximal Holevo information. Second, we discover that the information-theoretic approach yields an asymptotically optimal bound for an approximation variant of the problem. Finally, we derive a sharp lower bound for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem, with the exact leading order term, via the generalized Holevo-Curlander bounds on the distinguishability of an ensemble. All the aspects of the Quantum Coupon Collector problem we study rest on properties of the spectrum of the associated Gram matrix, which may be of independent interest.},

However, it is still not known how to find practical measurements with optimal precisions, even for uncorrelated measurements over probe states. Here, we give a concrete way to find uncorrelated measurement strategies with optimal precisions. We solve this fundamental problem by introducing a framework of conic programming that unifies the theory of precision bounds for multiparameter estimates for uncorrelated and correlated measurement strategies under a common umbrella. Namely, we give precision bounds that arise from linear programs on various cones defined on a tensor product space of matrices, including a particular cone of separable matrices. Subsequently, our theory allows us to develop an efficient algorithm that calculates both upper and lower bounds for the ultimate precision bound for uncorrelated measurement strategies, where these bounds can be tight. In particular, the uncorrelated measurement strategy that arises from our theory saturates the upper bound to the ultimate precision bound. Also, we show numerically that there is a strict gap between the previous efficiently computable bounds and the ultimate precision bound.},

abstract = {In this work we present a method for generating a fermionic encoding tailored to a set of target fermionic operators and to a target hardware connectivity. Our method uses brute force search, over the space of all encodings which map from Majorana monomials to Pauli operators, to find an encoding which optimizes a target cost function. In contrast to earlier works in this direction, our method searches over an extremely broad class of encodings which subsumes all known second quantized encodings that constitute algebra homomorphisms. In order to search over this class, we give a clear mathematical explanation of how precisely it is characterized, and how to translate this characterization into constructive search criteria. A benefit of searching over this class is that our method is able to supply fairly general optimality guarantees on solutions. A second benefit is that our method is, in principal, capable of finding more efficient representations of fermionic systems when the set of fermionic operators under consideration are faithfully represented by a smaller quotient algebra. Given the high algorithmic cost of performing the search, we adapt our method to handle translationally invariant systems that can be described by a small unit cell that is less costly. We demonstrate our method on various pairings of target fermionic operators and hardware connectivities. We additionally show how our method can be extended to find error detecting fermionic encodings in this class.},

The key idea is to build entanglement renormalization circuits by interleaving the conventional multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) circuit (made of spatially local gates) with quasi-local evolution. Given the miraculous power of this circuit to prepare a wide range of chiral topologically ordered states, we refer to these circuits as MERA with quasi-local evolution (MERAQLE).},

We show that these classes include bipartite pure, maximally correlated, GHZ, Bell diagonal, isotropic, and generalized Dicke states. Previously, additivity was established only if both states belong to the same class. Moreover, we extend these results to entanglement monotones based on the α-$z$ Rényi relative entropy. Notably, this family of monotones includes also the generalized robustness of entanglement and the geometric measure of entanglement. In addition, we prove that any monotone based on a quantum relative entropy is not additive for general states. 
We also compute closed-form expressions of the monotones for bipartite pure, Bell diagonal, isotropic, generalized Werner, generalized Dicke, and maximally correlated Bell diagonal states. Our results rely on proving new necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimizer of the monotones based on the α-$z$ R'enyi relative entropy, which allow us to reduce the original optimization problem to a simpler linear one. Even though we focus mostly on entanglement theory, we formulate some of our technical results in a general resource theory framework, and we expect that they could be used to investigate other resource theories.},

abstract = {We consider two related tasks: (a) estimating a parameterisation of a given Gibbs state and expectation values of Lipschitz observables on this state; and (b) learning the expectation values of local observables within a thermal or quantum phase of matter. In both cases, we wish to minimise the number of samples we use to learn these properties to a given precision. 
For the first task, we develop new techniques to learn parameterisations of classes of systems, including quantum Gibbs states of non-commuting Hamiltonians with exponential decay of correlations and the approximate Markov property. We show it is possible to infer the expectation values of all extensive properties of the state from a number of copies that not only scales polylogarithmically with the system size, but polynomially in the observable's locality – an exponential improvement. This set of properties includes expected values of quasi-local observables and entropies. For the second task, we develop efficient algorithms for learning observables in a phase of matter of a quantum system. By exploiting the locality of the Hamiltonian, we show that M local observables can be learned with probability 1−δ to precision ϵ with using only N=O(log(Mδ)epolylog(ϵ−1)) samples – an exponential improvement on the precision over previous bounds. Our results apply to both families of ground states of Hamiltonians displaying local topological quantum order, and thermal phases of matter with exponential decay of correlations. In addition, our sample complexity applies to the worse case setting whereas previous results only applied on average. Furthermore, we develop tools of independent interest, such as robust shadow tomography algorithms, Gibbs approximations to ground states, and generalisations of transportation cost inequalities for Gibbs states.},

abstract = {Energy estimation in quantum many-body Hamiltonians is a paradigmatic task in various research fields. In particular, efficient energy estimation may be crucial in achieving a quantum advantage for a practically relevant problem. For instance, the measurement effort poses a crucial bottleneck in variational quantum algorithms. We aim to find the optimal strategy with single-qubit measurements that yields the highest provable accuracy given a total measurement budget. As a central tool, we establish new tail bounds for empirical estimators of the energy. They are useful for identifying measurement settings that improve the energy estimate the most. This task constitutes an NP-hard problem. However, we are able to circumvent this bottleneck and use the tail bounds to develop a practical efficient estimation strategy which we call ShadowGrouping. As the name suggests, it combines shadow estimation methods with grouping strategies for Pauli strings. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that ShadowGrouping outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating the electronic ground-state energies of various small molecules, both in provable and effective accuracy benchmarks. Hence, this work provides a promising way, e.g., to tackle the measurement bottleneck of variational quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {We provide the sandwiched Renyi divergence of order $alphaın(1/2,1)$, as well as its induced quantum information quantities, with an operational interpretation in the characterization of the exact strong converse exponents of quantum tasks. Specifically, we consider (a) smoothing of the max-relative entropy, (b) quantum privacy amplification, and (c) quantum information decoupling. We solve the problem of determining the exact strong converse exponents for these three tasks, with the performance being measured by the fidelity or purified distance. The results are given in terms of the sandwiched Renyi divergence of order $alphaın(1/2,1)$, and its induced quantum Renyi conditional entropy and quantum Renyi mutual information. This is the first time to find the precise operational meaning for the sandwiched Renyi divergence with Renyi parameter in the interval $alphaın(1/2,1)$.},

abstract = {Recent progress in the development of quantum technologies has enabled the direct investigation of dynamics of increasingly complex quantum many-body systems. This motivates the study of the complexity of classical algorithms for this problem in order to benchmark quantum simulators and to delineate the regime of quantum advantage. Here we present classical algorithms for approximating the dynamics of local observables and nonlocal quantities such as the Loschmidt echo, where the evolution is governed by a local Hamiltonian. For short times, their computational cost scales polynomially with the system size and the inverse of the approximation error. In the case of local observables, the proposed algorithm has a better dependence on the approximation error than algorithms based on the Lieb–Robinson bound. Our results use cluster expansion techniques adapted to the dynamical setting, for which we give a novel proof of their convergence. This has important physical consequences besides our efficient algorithms. In particular, we establish a novel quantum speed limit, a bound on dynamical phase transitions, and a concentration bound for product states evolved for short times.},

abstract = {Large-scale quantum computers have the potential to hold computational capabilities beyond conventional computers for certain problems. However, the physical qubits within a quantum computer are prone to noise and decoherence, which must be corrected in order to perform reliable, fault-tolerant quantum computations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing such computations. QEC continuously generates a continuous stream of data that decoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 MHz in superconducting quantum computers. A little known fact of QEC is that if the decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered and the quantum computer runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog problem. That is: the current leading proposal for fault-tolerant quantum computation is not scalable. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our parallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed, leading to a slow-down of the logical clock speed. However, the slow-down is now only polynomial in code size, averting the exponential slowdown. We numerically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code, showing no noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders and demonstrating the parallelization speedup.},

We achieve this by introducing a fermionic encoding that leverages the locality of materials Hamiltonians describing an active space in the Wannier basis. This design generates quantum circuits whose depth is independent of the system’s size.},

abstract = {The ground state energy and the free energy of Quantum Local Hamiltonians are fundamental quantities in quantum many-body physics, however, it is QMA-Hard to estimate them in general. In this paper, we develop new techniques to find classical, additive error product-state approximations for these quantities on certain families of Quantum $k$-Local Hamiltonians. Namely, those which are either dense, have low threshold rank, or are defined on a sparse graph that excludes a fixed minor, building on the methods and the systems studied by Brandão and Harrow, Gharibian and Kempe, and Bansal, Bravyi and Terhal. We present two main technical contributions. First, we discuss a connection between product-state approximations of local Hamiltonians and combinatorial graph property testing. We develop a series of textitweak Szemer'edi regularity lemmas for $k$-local Hamiltonians, built on those of Frieze and Kannan and others. We use them to develop textitconstant time sampling algorithms, and to characterize the `vertex sample complexity' of the Local Hamiltonian problem, in an analog to a classical result by Alon, de la Vega, Kannan and Karpinski. Second, we build on the information-theoretic product-state approximation techniques by Brandão and Harrow, extending their results to the free energy and to an asymmetric graph setting. We leverage this structure to define families of algorithms for the free energy at low temperatures, and new algorithms for certain sparse graph families.},

(a) $latex mathsfBPP^QNC^BPP neq mathsfBQP$. This refutes Jozsa's conjecture [Joz05] in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing. 
(b) $latex mathsfQNC^BPP notsubseteq mathsfBPP^QNC$ and $latex mathsfBPP^QNC notsubseteq mathsfQNC^BPP$ This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements. 
(c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry [YZ22].

We focus on the regime where depth scales logarithmically in the system size and provide evidence that this retains the desirable sample complexity properties of both extremal schemes while also being experimentally feasible. We present methods for two key tasks; estimating expectation values of certain observables from generated classical shadows and, computing upper bounds on the depth-modulated shadow norm, thus providing rigorous guarantees on the accuracy of the output estimates. We achieve our findings by bringing together tools of shadow estimation, random circuits, and tensor networks.},

Originally derived for global Clifford unitaries and products of single-qubit Clifford gates, practical implementations are limited to the latter scheme for moderate numbers of qubits. Beyond local gates, the accurate implementation of very short random circuits with two-local gates is still experimentally feasible and, therefore, interesting for implementing measurements in near-term applications. In this work, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for shadow estimation using brickwork circuits with two layers of parallel two-local Haar-random (or Clifford) unitaries. Besides the construction of the classical shadow, our results give rise to sample-complexity guarantees for estimating Pauli observables. We then compare the performance of shadow estimation with brickwork circuits to the established approach using local Clifford unitaries and find improved sample complexity in the estimation of observables supported on sufficiently many qubits.},

 We introduce a framework for proving approximate degree lower bounds for certain oracle identification problems, where the goal is to recover a hidden binary string $latex x ın 0, 1^n$ given possibly non-standard oracle access to it. Our lower bounds apply to decision versions of these problems, where the goal is to compute the parity of $latex x$. 
 We apply our framework to the ordered search and hidden string problems, proving nearly tight approximate degree lower bounds of $latex Ømega(n/łog^2 n)$ for each. These lower bounds generalize to the weakly unbounded error setting, giving a new quantum query lower bound for the hidden string problem in this regime. Our lower bounds are driven by randomized communication upper bounds for the greater-than and equality functions.},

abstract = {Quantum secret sharing (QSS) allows a dealer to distribute a secret quantum state among a set of parties in such a way that certain authorized subsets can reconstruct the secret, while unauthorized subsets obtain no information about it. Previous works on QSS for general access structures focused solely on the existence of perfectly secure schemes, and the share size of the known schemes is necessarily exponential even in cases where the access structure is computed by polynomial size monotone circuits. This stands in stark contrast to the classical setting, where polynomial-time computationally-secure secret sharing schemes have been long known for all access structures computed by polynomial-size monotone circuits under standard hardness assumptions, and one can even obtain shares which are much shorter than the secret (which is impossible with perfect security). 
While QSS was introduced over twenty years ago, previous works only considered information-theoretic privacy. In this work, we initiate the study of computationally-secure QSS and show that computational assumptions help significantly in building QSS schemes, just as in the classical case. We present a simple compiler and use it to obtain a large variety results: We construct polynomial-time computationally-secure QSS schemes under standard hardness assumptions for a rich class of access structures. This includes many access structures for which previous results in QSS necessarily required exponential share size. In fact, we can go even further: We construct QSS schemes for which the size of the quantum shares is significantly smaller than the size of the secret. As in the classical setting, this is impossible with perfect security. We also apply our compiler to obtain results beyond computational QSS. In the information-theoretic setting, we improve the share size of perfect QSS schemes for a large class of $n$-party access structures to $1.5^n+o(n)$, improving upon best known schemes and matching the best known result for general access structures in the classical setting. Finally, among other things, we study the class of access structures which can be efficiently implemented when the quantum secret sharing scheme has access to a given number of copies of the secret, including all such functions in $mathsfP$ and $mathsfNP$.},

Our first result is a new quantum algorithm that performs variable time search with complexity $O(sqrtTłog n)$ where $T=sum_i=1^n t_i^2$ with $t_i$ denoting the time to check the $i^rm th$ item. Our second result is a quantum lower bound of $Ømega(sqrtTłog T)$. Both the algorithm and the lower bound improve over previously known results by a factor of $sqrtłog T$ but the algorithm is also substantially simpler than the previously known quantum algorithms.},

This protocol offers several advantages over other device-independent schemes including symmetry between the two users and no need for pre-shared randomness. We close a ``synchronicity'' loophole by showing that an almost synchronous correlation inherits the self-testing property of the associated synchronous correlation. We also pose a new security assumption that closes the ``locality'' (or ``causality'') loophole: an unbounded adversary with even a small uncertainty about the users' choice of measurement bases cannot produce any almost synchronous correlation that approximately maximally violates a synchronous Bell inequality.},

We then use representation theory to show that no classical witness can help a quantum verifier efficiently decide this problem relative to an in-place oracle.

Previous works have already shown that speed-ups in learning are possible when given quantum access to reinforcement learning environments. Yet, the applicability of quantum algorithms in this setting remains very limited, notably in environments with large state and action spaces. In this work, we design quantum algorithms to train state-of-the-art reinforcement learning policies by exploiting quantum interactions with an environment. However, these algorithms only offer full quadratic speed-ups in sample complexity over their classical analogs when the trained policies satisfy some regularity conditions. Interestingly, we find that reinforcement learning policies derived from parametrized quantum circuits are well-behaved with respect to these conditions, which showcases the benefit of a fully-quantum reinforcement learning framework.},

abstract = {The recently-defined No Low-energy Sampleable States (NLSS) conjecture of Gharibian and Le Gall [GL22] posits the existence of a family of local Hamiltonians where all states of low-enough constant energy do not have succinct representations allowing perfect sampling access. States that can be prepared using only Clifford gates (i.e. stabilizer states) are an example of sampleable states, so the NLSS conjecture implies the existence of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy space contains no stabilizer states. We describe families that exhibit this requisite property via a simple alteration to local Hamiltonians corresponding to CSS codes. Our method can also be applied to the recent NLTS Hamiltonians of Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe [ABN22], resulting in a family of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy space contains neither stabilizer states nor trivial states. We hope that our techniques will eventually be helpful for constructing Hamiltonians which simultaneously satisfy NLSS and NLTS.

Here we show that such a result does not generalize to quartic polynomials and 2-query algorithms, even when we allow for additive approximations. We also show that the additive approximation implied by their result is tight for bounded bilinear forms, which gives a new characterization of the Grothendieck constant in terms of 1-query quantum algorithms. Along the way we provide reformulations of the completely bounded norm of a form, and its dual norm.},

abstract = {Quantum walks provide a natural framework to approach graph problems with quantum computers, exhibiting speedups over their classical counterparts for tasks such as the search for marked nodes or the prediction of missing links. Continuous-time quantum walk algorithms assume that we can simulate the dynamics of quantum systems where the Hamiltonian is given by the adjacency matrix of the graph. It is known that such can be simulated efficiently if the underlying graph is row-sparse and efficiently row-computable. While this is sufficient for many applications, it limits the applicability for this class of algorithms to study real world complex networks, which, among other properties, are characterized by the existence of a few densely connected nodes, called hubs. In other words, complex networks are typically not row-sparse, even though the average connectivity over all nodes can be very small. In this work, we extend the state-of-the-art results on quantum simulation to graphs that contain a small number of hubs, but that are otherwise sparse. Hopefully, our results may lead to new applications of quantum computing to network science},

abstract = {Classical games are fundamentally modified in the quantum realm, due to non-locality and entanglement, which overlook some of the crucial features of the classical problem that define a dilemma [1,2]. Therefore, we analyze how the dilemma can be diverted and even 
completely eliminated by players using quantum strategies from the point of view of joint probabilities [3], based on the fact that quantum games are characterized by the nature of their joint probabilities; if these are factorable, it is a classical game, otherwise, it is a quantum game. In this way, in this work, we extend the focus of the 
non-factorizable joint probabilities when obtaining expressions that do not allow determining Nash equilibria in games [4]. Likewise, we introduce entropy as a definition of game information, in which the game is considered as an information channel, by incorporating it into the game strategies, we obtain equilibria that eliminate dilemmas. In addition to obtaining better performance than channels information channels, such as the Flip channel. We also connect the potential of 
the formalism of quantum games with the transmission of quantum information in noisy channels quantum and recent considerations of the connection between the mechanisms of thermalization in the 
statistical mechanics, the many-body problem, and cooperative games considered here in the quantum regime. Being this the first work in which the information is used in the strategies of the game in order to solve the dilemmas of these.

abstract = {The problem of Phase Estimation (or Amplitude Estimation) admits a quadratic quantum speedup. Wang, Higgott and Brierley [2019, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 140504] have shown that there is a continuous trade-off between quantum speedup and circuit depth (by defining a family of algorithms known as α-QPE). In this work, we show that the scaling of α-QPE can be naturally and succinctly derived within the framework of Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). From the QSVT perspective, a greater number of coherent oracle calls translates into a better polynomial approximation to the sign function, which is the key routine for solving Phase Estimation. The better the approximation to the sign function, the fewer samples one needs to determine the sign accurately. With this idea, we simplify the proof of α-QPE, while providing a new interpretation of the interpolation parameters, and show that QSVT is a promising framework for reasoning about classical-quantum interpolations.},

abstract = {Cyber-attacks are increasingly seeking access to private information held by individuals or corporations. Cryptography is used to protect data by including methods to prevent attackers from acquiring it. However, the inevitable arrival of large-scale quantum computers in the upcoming years is expected to impact the security offered by today’s 
various cryptosystems. Several suggestions have been presented to the NIST-initiated procedure, which focuses on the evaluation and standardization of one, or perhaps more quantum-resistant public-key cryptography algorithms in order to mitigate the hazards associated with quantum computing. This paper examines the impact of quantum 
technologies on several of these proposals and explores a number of post-quantum cryptography techniques. A full examination of cryptosystems is also provided in order to propose a secure, quantum-resistant solution that might be used in a variety of sectors, including online banking. Based on various parameters, this study compares multiple traditional and CRYSTALS-Kyber post-quantum cryptography approaches.},

The interplay of the unitary symmetry of these states and the inherent bipartite permutation symmetry of the extendibility scenario allows us to map this problem into the ground state problem of a highly symmetric spin-model Hamiltonian. We solve this ground state problem analytically by utilizing the representation theory of SU(d), in particular a result related to the dominance order of Young diagrams in Littlewood-Richarson decompositions. As a result, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the extendibility of Werner states for arbitrary extension size and local dimension. Interestingly, the range of extendible states has a non-trivial trade-off between the extension sizes on the two sides. We compare our result with the two-sided extendibility problem of isotropic states, where there is no such trade-off.},

abstract = {In this work, we deal with the relaxation of two central assumptions in standard locally realistic hidden variable (LRHV) inequalities: free will in choosing measurement settings, and the presence of perfect detectors at the measurement devices. Quantum correlations violating LRHV inequalities are called quantum nonlocal correlations. In principle, in an adversarial situation, there could be a hidden variable introducing bias in the selection of measurement settings, but observers with no access to that hidden variable could be unaware of the bias. In practice, however, detectors do not have perfect efficiency. A main focus of this work is the introduction of the framework in which given a quantum state with nonlocal behavior under constrained free will, we can determine the threshold values of detector parameters (detector inefficiency and dark counts) such that the detectors are robust enough to certify nonlocality. We also introduce a class of LRHV inequalities with constrained free will, and we discuss their implications in the testing of quantum nonlocal correlations.},

The study of ever more restricted classes of quantum circuits capable of quantum advantage is motivated by possible simplifications in experimental demonstrations. In this paper we study the efficiency of measurement-based quantum computation with a completely flat temporal ordering of measurements. We propose new constructions for the deterministic computation of arbitrary Boolean functions, drawing on correlations present in multi-qubit Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ) states. We characterize the necessary measurement complexity using the Clifford hierarchy, and also generally decrease the number of qubits needed with respect to previous constructions. In particular, we identify a family of Boolean functions for which deterministic evaluation using non-adaptive MBQC is possible, featuring quantum advantage in width and number of gates with respect to classical circuits.},

abstract = {A promising avenue for the preparation of Gibbs states on a quantum computer is to simulate the physical thermalization process. The Davies generator describes the dynamics of an open quantum system that is in contact with a heat bath. Crucially, it does not require simulation of the heat bath itself, only the system we hope to thermalize. Using the state-of-the-art techniques for quantum simulation of the Lindblad equation, we devise a technique for the preparation of Gibbs states via thermalization as specified by the Davies generator. In doing so, we encounter a severe technical challenge: implementation of the Davies generator demands the ability to estimate the energy of the system unambiguously. That is, each energy of the system must be deterministically mapped to a unique estimate. Previous work showed that this is only possible if the system satisfies an unphysical 'rounding promise' assumption. We solve this problem by engineering a random ensemble of rounding promises that simultaneously solves three problems: First, each rounding promise admits preparation of a 'promised' thermal state via a Davies generator. Second, these Davies generators have a similar mixing time as the ideal Davies generator. Third, the average of these promised thermal states approximates the ideal thermal state.},

author = {Gregory A. Hamilton and Felix Leditzky},
year  = {2023},
date = {2023-01-01},
abstract = {We propose a study of multipartite entanglement through persistent homology, a tool 
used in topological data analysis. In persistent homology, a 1-parameter filtration of simplicial 
complexes called a persistence complex is used to reveal persistent topological features 
of the underlying data set. This is achieved via the computation of homological invariants 
that can be visualized as a persistence barcode encoding all relevant topological information. 
In this work, we apply this technique to study multipartite quantum systems by interpreting 
the individual systems as vertices of a simplicial complex. To construct a persistence 
complex from a given multipartite quantum state, we use a generalization of the bipartite 
mutual information called the deformed total correlation as the defining functional. This 
correlation measure is monotonic with respect to tracing out systems, and thus defines a 
valid filtration of simplicial complexes. Computing the persistence barcodes of this complex 
yields a visualization or ‘topological fingerprint’ of the multipartite entanglement in the 
quantum state. The barcodes can also be used to compute a topological summary called 
the integrated Euler characteristic of a persistence complex. We show that for the persistence 
complex defined in terms of the total correlation, this integrated Euler characteristic 
is equal to the deformed interaction information, another multipartite version of mutual 
information. In particular, when choosing the linear entropy as the underlying entropy, this 
deformed interaction information coincides with the n-tangle, a well-known entanglement 
monotone. The persistence barcodes therefore provide more fine-grained information about 
the entanglement structure than its topological summary, the n-tangle, alone, which we 
illustrate with examples of pairs of states with identical n-tangle but different barcodes. 
Furthermore, a variant of persistent homology computed relative to a fixed subset yields an 
interesting connection to strong subadditivity and entropy inequalities. Finally, we discuss 
how our approach can be generalized to arbitrary resource theories by choosing suitable functionals such as generalized divergences.},

The second is the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states by means of LOCC from the given mixed state. These problem settings extend our previous paper [FS & AW, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(2):976-988, 2022], and we generalise its results: using a quantum version of the task of communication for omniscience, we derive a novel lower bound on the distillable secret key from any multipartite quantum state by means of a so-called non-interacting communication protocol. Secondly, by making the secret key distillation protocol coherent, we derive novel lower bounds on the distillation rate of GHZ states.},

abstract = {Pauli-based computation (PBC) is a universal model for quantum computation with qubits where the input state is a tensor product of magic states and the computation is driven by a sequence of adaptively chosen and compatible multi-qubit Pauli measurements. Here we generalize PBC for odd prime dimensional systems and demonstrate its universality. Additionally, we discuss how any qudit-based PBC can be implemented on actual, circuit-based quantum hardware. Our results show that we can translate a PBC on $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits to adaptive circuits on $n+1$ qudits with $Ołeft( (p-1)n^2/2 right)$ textscsum gates and depth. Alternatively, we can carry out the same computation with $Ołeft( (p-1)n/2right)$ depth at the expense of an increased circuit width. Finally, we show that the sampling complexity associated with simulating a number $k$ of virtual qudits is related to the robustness of magic of the input states. Computation of this magic monotone for qutrit and ququint states leads to sampling complexity upper bounds of, respectively, $Ołeft( 3^ 1.0848 k epsilon^-2right)$ and $Ołeft( 5^ 1.4022 k epsilon^-2right)$, for a desired precision ε. We further establish lower bounds to this sampling complexity for qubits, qutrits, and ququints: $Ømega łeft( 2^0.5431 k epsilon^-2 right)$, $Ømega łeft( 3^0.7236 k epsilon^-2 right)$, and $Ømega łeft( 5^0.8544 k epsilon^-2 right)$, respectively.},

abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been proposed as one of the most promising approaches to demonstrate quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, it has been unclear whether VQAs can maintain quantum advantage under the intrinsic noise of the NISQ devices, which deteriorates the quantumness. Here we propose a measure, called $textitfermionic nonlinearity$, to quantify the classical simulatability of quantum circuits designed for simulating fermionic Hamiltonians. Specifically, we construct a Monte Carlo type classical algorithm based on the classical simulatability of fermionic linear optics, whose sampling overhead is characterized by the fermionic nonlinearity. As a demonstration of these techniques, we calculate the upper bound of the fermionic nonlinearity of a rotation gate generated by four fermionic modes under the dephasing noise. Moreover, we estimate the sampling costs of the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles quantum circuits for hydrogen chains subject to the dephasing noise. We find that, depending on the error probability and atomic spacing, there are regions where the fermionic nonlinearity becomes very small or unity, and hence the circuits are classically simulatable. We also study the overhead of a quantum error mitigation method when applying it to noisy parametrized quantum circuits and compare the overheads with the sampling costs of simulating error-free parametrized quantum circuits by our proposed method. We believe that our method and results help to design quantum circuits for fermionic systems with potential quantum advantages.},

title = {Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning for real-time context-aware Gate Calibration},

abstract = {The advent of quantum computers in the near-term prospect induces the need of mitigating various sources of noise that corrupt quantum information, preventing the successful execution of quantum algorithms. While noise characterization in hardware has been the subject of many investigations [1], scaling up the size of quantum systems involves additional noise sources that go beyond what basic noise models can describe. To cope with this issue, many techniques relying on experimental feedback have been used to 
 build more accurate quantum gate operations [2-5]. However, the considered problems at hand are usually tackled in a static background, in the sense that each gate is calibrated independently of the context it is meant to be used in, such as an algorithm. 
 For instance, playing a two-qubit gate for two specific qubits of the processor while running other gates on neighboring qubits yields a different gate fidelity from the case where those latter are maintained idle, as a result of non-local crosstalk. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to use model-free reinforcement learning to calibrate gate operations in situ. Reinforcement Learning has proven to be a valuable tool in many quantum tasks [4-8]. We therefore employ this method to calibrate a two-qubit gate directly from experimental data, while ensuring low sampling overhead. We restrict the action space to pulse parameters that can be adjusted in real time, i.e. parameters that are tunable without having to load a new waveform in the control system and therefore without having to recompile the quantum circuit. That way, one can adapt the initial gate calibration based on where (on which qubits) and when (at which time stamp) it is applied in the circuit to mitigate noisy interactions that uniquely define our dynamical system. As the feature of real-time pulse parameter update is enabled by current state-of-the-art control systems [9], we envision our method to stand as a practical calibration subroutine that could lower the usual latency overhead induced 
 by the need of recompiling the entire adapted waveform which is a common drawback in feedback-based optimal control protocols. We believe this stochastic method would stand as a complementary tool to other optimal control and circuit compilation approaches 
 for pushing further noise mitigation strategies in a relevant context of quantum algorithms execution.

abstract = {A well-known method to prepare ground states of fermionic many-body hamiltonians is adiabatic state preparation, in which an easy to prepare state is time-evolved towards an approximate ground state under a specific time-dependent hamiltonian. However, which path to take in the evolution is often unclear, and a direct linear interpolation, which is the most common method, may not be optimal. In this work, we explore new types of adiabatic paths based on an eigendecomposition of the coefficient tensor in the second quantised representation of the difference between the final and initial hamiltonian (the residual hamiltonian). Since there is an equivalence between this tensor and a projection of the residual hamiltonian onto the subspace of two particles, this approach is essentially a two-body spectral decomposition. We show how for general hamiltonians, the adiabatic time complexity may be upper bounded in terms of the number of one-body modes $latex L$ and a minimal gap $latex Delta$ along the path. Our finding is that the complexity is determined primarily by the degree of pairing in the two-body states. As a result, systems whose two-body eigenstates are uniform superpositions of distinct fermion pairs tend to exhibit maximal complexity, which scales as $latex O(L^4/Delta^3)$ in direct interpolation and $latex O(L^6/Delta^3)$ in an evolution that follows a path along the corners of a hypercube in parameter space. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated through a few examples involving Fermi-Hubbard models where, due to symmetries, level crossings occur in direct interpolation. We show that our method of decomposing the residual hamiltonian and thereby deviating from a direct path appropriately breaks the relevant symmetries, thus avoiding level crossings and enabling an adiabatic passage.},

abstract = {In the context of Quantum Communication theory, a lossy channel is a quantum channel that can describe a wide variety of scenarios that cause an attenuation of the input signal, such as the transmission in an optical fiber or free-space communication. From the mathematical point of view, a lossy channel is described as an interaction, mediated by a beam-splitter with fixed transmissivity, between the input state and the environment state, which is the vacuum state. 
In some realistic situations, as the transmission of photons through the atmosphere, the noise that affects the quantum carrier cannot be described by a single lossy channel, because of the fluctuations in the loss parameter. Therefore, it is better to model these scenarios considering an ensemble of lossy channels. 
The classical capacity of a quantum channel is the asymptotic rate of transmission of classical information, sent from a sender to a receiver, when the quantum system that carries the information is subject to the noise described by the quantum channel. If sender and receiver share an unlimited amount of entanglement that can be used to improve the communication, one can define the entanglement-assisted classical capacity. In this work, we studied some families of channels, that are convex combinations of two different lossy channels and, in order to describe such a convex combination, we used an ancillary qubit that selects one or the other channel. We found that, for those channels, there exist quantum states with a better communication performance with respect to the thermal state with the same energy; this is surprising because it is known that a thermal state is the best choice for a single lossy channel. However, using the methods developed in this work, it is possible to model even more general scenarios, in order to improve the quantum communication performance of more realistic noises.},

abstract = {We consider the task of spectral estimation of local quantum Hamiltonians. The spectral estimation is performed by estimating the oscillation frequencies or decay rates of signals representing the time evolution of states. We present a classical Monte Carlo (MC) scheme which efficiently estimates an imaginary-time, decaying signal for stoquastic (i.e. sign-problem-free) local Hamiltonians. The decay rates in this signal correspond to Hamiltonian eigenvalues (with associated eigenstates present in an input state) and can be extracted using a classical signal processing method like ESPRIT. We compare the efficiency of this MC scheme to its quantum counterpart in which one extracts eigenvalues of a general local Hamiltonian from a real-time, oscillatory signal obtained through quantum phase estimation circuits, again using the ESPRIT method. We prove that the ESPRIT method can resolve S = poly(n) eigenvalues, assuming a 1/poly(n) gap between them, with poly(n) quantum and classical effort through the quantum phase estimation (QPE) circuits, assuming efficient preparation of the input state. We prove that our MC scheme plus the ESPRIT method can resolve S = O(1) eigenvalues, assuming a 1/poly(n) gap between them, with poly(n) purely classical effort for stoquastic Hamiltonians, requiring some access structure to the input state. However, we also show that under these assumptions, i.e. S = O(1) eigenvalues, assuming a 1/poly(n) gap between them and some access structure to the input state, one can achieve this with poly(n) purely classical effort for general local Hamiltonians. These results thus quantify some opportunities and limitations of MC methods for spectral estimation of Hamiltonians. We numerically compare the MC eigenvalue estimation scheme (for stoquastic Hamiltonians) and the quantum-phase-estimation-based eigenvalue estimation scheme by implementing them for an archetypal stoquastic Hamiltonian system: the transverse field Ising chain.},

abstract = {A fundamental fact about bounded-degree graph expanders is that three notions of expansion—vertex expansion, edge expansion, and spectral expansion—are all equivalent. In this paper, we study to what extent such a statement is true for linear-algebraic notions of expansion. There are two well-studied notions of linear-algebraic expansion, namely dimension expansion [1] (defined in analogy to graph vertex expansion) and quantum expansion [2, 3] (defined in analogy to graph spectral expansion). Lubotzky and Zelmanov [4] proved that the latter implies the former. We prove that the converse is false: there are dimension expanders which are not quantum expanders. Moreover, this asymmetry is explained by the fact that there are two distinct linear-algebraic analogues of graph edge expansion. The first of these is quantum edge expansion, which was introduced by Hastings [5], and which he proved to be equivalent to quantum expansion. We introduce a new notion, termed dimension edge expansion, which we prove is equivalent to dimension expansion and which is implied by quantum edge expansion. Thus, the separation above is implied by a finer one: dimension edge expansion is strictly weaker than quantum edge expansion. This new notion also leads to a new, more modular proof of the Lubotzky-Zelmanov result [4] that quantum expanders are dimension expanders.

abstract = {Quantum Fisher information (QFI) characterizes the amount of information a quantum state carries about an unknown parameter, assuming arbitrary measurements on the quantum state. However, in practice, quantum measurements are noisy, preventing most metrological protocols from achieving parameter estimation in line with the QFI of a given quantum state. Here, we study protocols that allow preprocessing of quantum states using quantum controls before measurement. We introduce the concept of error observables and formulate the problem of identifying the optimal quantum controls in this setting as a biconvex optimization. Based on this formulation, we prove that unitary channels are optimal for pure states and derive analytical solutions for the optimal controls in cases of practical relevance. In the context of commuting measurement operators and classically mixed states (i.e., states for which the unknown parameter is encoded in the eigenvalues), we prove that coarse-graining channels are optimal and provide a counterexample to the optimality of unitary controls. For general quantum states and measurements, we provide useful upper and lower bounds on the Fisher information optimized over preprocessing controls. Finally, we consider quantum states in a multipartite system with local noisy measurements acting independently on each subsystem and prove that in the asymptotic limit, the QFI is attainable using global optimal controls for a generic class of quantum states.},

abstract = {Among the strangest properties of quantum mechanics there is certainly the fact that acting on a quantum system disturbs it. This phenomenon has always been at the center of an extremely active line of research, and only recently, thanks to quantum information analysis tools, we have begun to understand it more deeply. In our work we continued the characterization of this property by demonstrating that this disturbance action is logically independent from the property of complementarity, i.e. the existence of couples of observables that is impossible to measure simultaneously. To do this we have built two different toy theories, called Minimal Classical Theory and Minimal Strongly-causal Bilocal Classical Theory within the framework of operational probabilistic theories, which posses the former property, but not the latter.},

abstract = {Quantum state preparation is an important subroutine for quantum computing. We show that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared with a $Theta(n)$-depth circuit using only single- and two-qubit gates, although with a cost of an exponential amount of ancillary qubits. On the other hand, for sparse quantum states with $dgeqslant2$ non-zero entries, we can reduce the circuit depth to $Theta(łog(nd))$ with $O(ndłog d)$ ancillary qubits. The algorithm for sparse states is exponentially faster than best-known results and the number of ancillary qubits is nearly optimal and only increases polynomially with the system size. We discuss applications of the results in different quantum computing tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation, solving linear systems of equations, and realizing quantum random access memories, and find cases with exponential reductions of the circuit depth for all these three tasks. In particular, using our algorithm, we find a family of linear system solving problems enjoying exponential speedups, even compared to the best-known quantum and classical dequantization algorithms.},

abstract = {We consider two classes of quantum generalisations of Random Access Code (RAC) and study lower bounds for probabilities of success for such tasks. It provides a useful framework for studying certain information-processing tasks with constrained resources. The first class is based on a random access code with quantum inputs and output known as No-Signalling Quantum RAC (NS-QRAC) [A. Grudka et al. Phys. Rev. A 92, 052312 (2015)], where unbounded entanglement and constrained classical communication are allowed, which can be seen as quantum teleportation with constrained classical communication, for which we provide a quantum lower bound. We consider two modifications to the NS-QRAC scenario, first where unbounded entanglement and constrained quantum communication is allowed and, second where bounded entanglement and unconstrained classical communication are allowed, where we find a monogamy relation for the transmission fidelities, which – in contrast to the usual communication schemes – involves multiple senders and a single receiver. We provide lower bounds for these scenarios. The second class is based on a random access code with a quantum channel and shared entanglement [A. Tavakoli et al. PRX Quantum 2 (4) 040357 (2021)]. We study the set of tasks where two inputs made of two digits of d-base are encoded over a qudit and a maximally entangled state, which can be seen as quantum dense coding with constrained quantum communication, for which we provide quantum lower bounds for d=2,3,4. The encoding employed utilises Gray codes.},

abstract = {In superconducting architectures, limited connectivity remains a significant challenge for the synthesis and compilation of quantum circuits. We consider models of entanglement-assisted computation where long-range operations are achieved through injections of entangled CAT states. These are prepared using ancillary qubits acting as an "entanglement bus," unlocking global operation primitives such as multi-qubit Pauli rotations and fan out gates. We derive bounds on the circuit size for several well-studied problems, such as CZ circuit, CX circuit, and Clifford circuit synthesis. In particular, in an architecture using one such entanglement bus, we show that Clifford operations require at most $2n+1$ layers of entangled-state-injections, significantly improving upon the best known SWAP-based approaches which achieve an entangling-gate-depth of $7n−4$. In a square-lattice architecture with two entanglement buses, we show that a graph state can be synthesized using at most $łceil n/2 rceil +1$ layers of CAT state injections, and Clifford operations require only $łceil 3n/2 rceil +O(sqrtn)$ layers of CAT state injections.},

abstract = {When preparing a pure state with a quantum circuit, there is an inevitable coherent error since each unitary gate suffers from the discretized coherent error due to fault-tolerant implementation. A recently proposed approach called probabilistic state synthesis, where the circuit is probabilistically sampled to turn such coherent errors into incoherent ones, is able to reduce the order of the approximation error compared to conventional deterministic synthesis. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal probabilistic synthesis quadratically reduces the approximation error with respect to the trace distance. We also show that a deterministic synthesis algorithm can be efficiently converted into a probabilistic one to achieve quadratic error reduction. To estimate how the error reduction reduces the circuit size, we show that probabilistic encoding asymptotically halves the length of the classical bit string, which provides a general lower bound on the circuit size, required to approximately encode a pure state. To derive these results, we prove general theorems about the optimal convex approximation of a quantum state by using a restricted subset of quantum states. As another application of our theorem, we provide exact formulas for the minimum trace distance between an entangled state and the set of separable states and alternate proof about a recently identified coincidence between an entanglement measure and a coherence measure.},
