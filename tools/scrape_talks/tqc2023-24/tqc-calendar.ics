DESCRIPTION:We prove that any two-party correlation in the commuting operat
 or model can be approximated using a tracial embeddable strategy\, a class 
 of strategy defined on a finite tracial von Neumann algebra\, which we defi
 ne in this paper. Using this characterization\, we show that any approximat
 ely synchronous correlation can be approximated to the average of a collect
 ion of synchronous correlations in the commuting operator model. This gener
 alizes the result from Vidick [JMP 2022] which only applies to finite-dimen
 sional quantum correlations. As a corollary\, we show that the quantum tens
 or code test from Ji et al. [FOCS 2022] follows the soundness property even
  under the general commuting operator model. Furthermore\, we extend the st
 ate-dependent norm variant of the Gowers-Hatami theorem to finite von Neuma
 nn algebras. Combined with the aforementioned characterization\, this enabl
 es us to lift many known results about robust self-testing for non-local ga
 mes to the commuting operator model\, including a sample efficient finite-d
 imensional EPR testing for the commuting operator strategies. We believe th
 at\, in addition to the contribution from this paper\, this class of strate
 gies can be helpful for further understanding non-local games in the infini
 te-dimensional setting.

DESCRIPTION:The inherent irreversibility of quantum dynamics for open syste
 ms poses a significant barrier to the inversion of unknown quantum processe
 s. To tackle this challenge\, we propose the framework of virtual combs tha
 t exploit the unknown process iteratively with additional classical post-pr
 ocessing to simulate the process inverse. Notably\, we demonstrate that an 
 $n$-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse a depolarizing channel with one u
 nknown noise parameter out of $n+1$ potential candidates\, and a 1-slot vir
 tual comb can exactly reverse an arbitrary pair of quantum channels. We fur
 ther explore the approximate inversion of an unknown channel within a given
  channel set. A worst-case error decay of $\\cO(n^{-1})$ is unveiled for de
 polarizing channels within a specified noise region. Moreover\, we show tha
 t virtual combs can universally reverse unitary operations and investigate 
 the trade-off between the slot number and the sampling overhead.

DESCRIPTION:Checking whether two quantum circuits are approximately equival
 ent is a common task in quantum computing. We consider a closely related id
 entity check problem: given a quantum circuit $U$\, one has to estimate the
  diamond-norm distance between $U$ and the identity channel. We present a c
 lassical algorithm approximating the distance to the identity within a fact
 or $\\alpha=D+1$ for shallow geometrically local $D$-dimensional circuits p
 rovided that the circuit is sufficiently close to the identity. The runtime
  of the algorithm scales linearly with the number of qubits for any constan
 t circuit depth and spatial dimension. We also show that the operator-norm 
 distance to the identity $\\|U-I\\|$ can be efficiently approximated within
  a factor $\\alpha=5$ for shallow 1D circuits and\, under a certain technic
 al condition\, within a factor $\\alpha=2D+3$ for shallow $D$-dimensional c
 ircuits. A numerical implementation of the identity check algorithm is repo
 rted for 1D Trotter circuits with up to 100 qubits.

DESCRIPTION:The Esscher Transform is a tool of broad utility in various dom
 ains of applied probability. It provides the solution to a constrained mini
 mum relative entropy optimization problem. In this work\, we study the gene
 ralization of the Esscher Transform to the quantum setting. We examine a re
 lative entropy minimization problem for a quantum density operator\, potent
 ially of wide relevance in quantum information theory. The resulting soluti
 on form motivates us to define the quantum Esscher Transform\, which subsum
 es the classical Esscher Transform as a special case. Envisioning potential
  applications of the quantum Esscher Transform\, we also discuss its implem
 entation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our algorithm is based on the
  modern techniques of block-encoding and quantum singular value transformat
 ion (QSVT). We show that given block-encoded inputs\, our algorithm outputs
  a subnormalized block-encoding of the quantum Esscher transform within acc
 uracy $\\epsilon$ in $\\tilde O(\\kappa d \\log^2 1/\\epsilon)$ queries to 
 the inputs\, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number of the input density o
 perator and $d$ is the number of constraints.

DESCRIPTION:<span>The Heisenberg limit (HL) and the standard quantum limit 
 (SQL) are two quantum metrological limits\, which describe the scalings of 
 estimation precision $\\Delta \\hat\\theta$ of an unknown parameter $\\thet
 a$ with respect to $n$\, the number of one-parameter quantum channels appli
 ed. It was known that the HL ($\\Delta \\hat\\theta \\propto 1/n$) is achie
 vable using quantum error correction (QEC) strategies when the ``Hamiltonia
 n-not-in-Kraus-span'' (HNKS) condition is satisfied\; and when HNKS is viol
 ated\, the SQL ($\\Delta \\hat\\theta \\propto 1/n^{1/2}$) is optimal and c
 an be achieved with $n$ repetitive measurements. However\, it is unknown wh
 ether such limits are still achievable using restricted quantum devices whe
 re the required QEC operations are not available---e.g.\, finite-size devic
 es where only unitary controls are available or where noiseless ancilla is 
 not available. In this work\, we identify various new noisy metrological li
 mits for estimating one-parameter qubit channels in different settings with
  restricted controls. The HL is proven to be unattainbale in these cases\, 
 indicating the necessity of QEC in achieving the HL. Furthermore\, we find 
 a necessary and sufficient condition for qubit channels to attain the SQL\,
  called the ``rotation-generators-not-in-Kraus-span'' (RGNKS) condition. Wh
 en RGNKS is satisfied\, the SQL is achievable using only unitary controls a
 nd a single measurement. When RGNKS is violated\, the estimation precision 
 (in most cases) has a constant floor when repetitive measurements are not a
 llowed. Demonstration of this separation in metrological powers is within r
 each of current quantum technologies.</span>

DESCRIPTION:Quantum nondeterministic distributed computing was recently int
 roduced as $\\mathsf{dQMA}$ (distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur) protocols b
 y Fraigniaud\, Le Gall\, Nishimura and Paz (ITCS 2021). In $\\mathsf{dQMA}$
  protocols\, with the help of quantum proofs and local communication\, node
 s on a network verify some global property of the network. Fraigniaud et al
 .~showed that\, when the network size is small\, there exists an exponentia
 l separation in proof size between distributed classical and quantum verifi
 cation protocols\, for the equality problem\, where the verifiers check if 
 all the data owned by a subset of them are identical or not. In this paper\
 , we further investigate and characterize the power of the $\\mathsf{dQMA}$
  protocols for various decision problems. First\, we give a more efficient 
 $\\mathsf{dQMA}$ protocol for the equality problem with a simpler analysis.
  This is done by adding a symmetrization step on each node and exploiting p
 roperties of the permutation test\, which is a generalization of the SWAP t
 est. We also show a quantum advantage for the equality problem on path netw
 orks still persists even when the network size is large\, by considering ``
 relay points'' between extreme nodes. Second\, we show that even in a gener
 al network\, there exist efficient $\\mathsf{dQMA}$ protocols for the ranki
 ng verification problem\, the Hamming distance problem\, and more problems 
 that derive from efficient quantum one-way communication complexity protoco
 ls. Third\, in a line network\, we construct an efficient $\\mathsf{dQMA}$ 
 protocol for a problem that has an efficient two-party $\\mathsf{QMA}$ comm
 unication complexity protocol. Finally\, we obtain the first lower bounds o
 n the proof and communication cost of $\\mathsf{dQMA}$ protocols. To prove 
 a lower bound on the equality problem\, we show any $\\mathsf{dQMA}$ protoc
 ol with an entangled proof between nodes can be simulated with a $\\mathsf{
 dQMA}$ protocol with a separable proof between nodes by using a $\\mathsf{Q
 MA}$ communication-complete problem introduced by Raz and Shpilka (CCC 2004
 ).

DESCRIPTION:We present a classical algorithm capable of estimating Born rul
 e probabilities of quantum circuits consisting of matchgate/Fermionic linea
 r optical (FLO) unitaries and non-FLO controlled-phase gates with arbitrary
  phases. Our algorithm has asymptotic runtime linear in an (in general) exp
 onentially large quantity we have named the “FLO-extent”\, and is at most p
 olynomial all other parameters. The FLO-extent is defined in a similar way 
 to the stabilizer extent known from the literature on quantum simulation us
 ing stabilizer decompositions. The FLO extent is sub-multiplicative\, and t
 he multiplicative upper bound leads to a runtime for our algorithm which do
 ubles for each swap gate\, or controlled-Z gate added to the circuit. Contr
 olled-phase gates with different phases have lower extent\, smoothly interp
 olating between 1 and 2. These numbers can be compared with the prior state
  of-the-art for this task\, the runtime of which is multiplied by a factor 
 9 for each CZ-gate. This dramatic difference in performance is due to our u
 se of methods we have developed to perform tasks in the FLO subtheory in a 
 phase-sensitive way\, allowing us to decompose the relevant “magic states” 
 at the level of statevectors rather than density operators. Our results are
  formulated for quantum circuits\, directly extending the class of quantum 
 computations that can be simulated using current classical computers. Howev
 er\, the FLO subtheory also naturally represents the evolution of non-inter
 acting Fermions\, while the addition of non-FLO unitaries to the circuit ca
 n represent interactions between Fermions. We therefore expect that our res
 ults will be applicable to classical simulations of weakly interacting Ferm
 ions\, with potential applications in condensed matter and quantum chemistr
 y research. In addition to practical simulation our work is part of the ong
 oing effort to understand the differences between the computational power o
 f classical and that of quantum mechanics. By extending classical simulatio
 n methods to new areas we can focus attention on those features of quantum 
 computations which are necessary for meaningful "quantum advantage".

DESCRIPTION:Fault-tolerant quantum computation using two-dimensional topolo
 gical quantum error correcting codes can benefit from multi-qubit long-rang
 e operations. By using simple commutation rules\, a quantum circuit can be 
 transpiled into a sequence of solely non-Clifford multi-qubit gates. Prior 
 work on fault-tolerant compilation avoids optimal scheduling of such gates 
 since they reduce the parallelizability of the circuit. We first show that\
 , using the tableau representation of Clifford gates\, this transpilation c
 an be run in linear time with respect to the circuit length\, and observe t
 hat the reduced parallelization potential is outweighed by the significant 
 reduction in the number of gates. We therefore devise a method for scheduli
 ng multi-qubit lattice surgery using an earliest-available-first policy\, s
 olving the associated forest packing problem using a representation of the 
 multi-qubit gates as Steiner trees. Our extensive testing on random and rea
 l-world circuits demonstrates the method's scalability and performance. We 
 show that the transpilation reduces the circuit length by 82% on average\, 
 and that the resulting circuit of multi-qubit gates has an average reductio
 n of 20.5% in the expected circuit execution time compared to serial execut
 ion.

DESCRIPTION:<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12946">http://arxiv.org/abs/
 2301.12946</a>        <br> <br>We consider two related tasks: (a) estimatin
 g a parameterisation of a given Gibbs state and expectation values of Lipsc
 hitz observables on this state\; and (b) learning the expectation values of
  local observables within a thermal or quantum phase of matter. In both cas
 es\, we wish to minimise the number of samples we use to learn these proper
 ties to a given precision.  For the first task\, we develop new techniques 
 to learn parameterisations of classes of systems\, including quantum Gibbs 
 states of non-commuting Hamiltonians with exponential decay of correlations
  and the approximate Markov property. We show it is possible to infer the e
 xpectation values of all extensive properties of the state from a number of
  copies that not only scales polylogarithmically with the system size\, but
  polynomially in the observable's locality -- an exponential improvement. T
 his set of properties includes expected values of quasi-local observables a
 nd entropies.  For the second task\, we develop efficient algorithms for le
 arning observables in a phase of matter of a quantum system. By exploiting 
 the locality of the Hamiltonian\, we show that M local observables can be l
 earned with probability 1−δ to precision ϵ with using only N=O(log(Mδ)epoly
 log(ϵ−1)) samples -- an exponential improvement on the precision over previ
 ous bounds. Our results apply to both families of ground states of Hamilton
 ians displaying local topological quantum order\, and thermal phases of mat
 ter with exponential decay of correlations. In addition\, our sample comple
 xity applies to the worse case setting whereas previous results only applie
 d on average.  Furthermore\, we develop tools of independent interest\, suc
 h as robust shadow tomography algorithms\, Gibbs approximations to ground s
 tates\, and generalisations of transportation cost inequalities for Gibbs s
 tates.

      <br> <br>Collapse binding and collapsing were proposed as post-quantum
  strengthenings of computational binding and collision resistance\, respect
 ively. These notions have been very successful in facilitating the "lifting
 " of classical security proofs to the quantum setting. A basic and natural 
 question remains unanswered\, however: are they the weakest notions that su
 ffice for such lifting?  In this work we answer this question in the affirm
 ative by giving a classical commit-and-open protocol which is post-quantum 
 secure if and only if the commitment scheme (resp. hash function) used is c
 ollapse binding (resp. collapsing). We also generalise the definition of co
 llapse binding to quantum commitment schemes\, and prove that the equivalen
 ce carries over when the sender in this commit-and-open protocol communicat
 es quantum information.  As a consequence\, we establish that a variety of 
 "weak" binding notions (sum binding\, CDMS binding and unequivocality) are 
 in fact equivalent to collapse binding\, both for post-quantum and quantum 
 commitments.  Finally\, we prove a "win-win" result\, showing that a post-q
 uantum computationally binding commitment scheme that is not collapse bindi
 ng can be used to build an equivocal commitment scheme (which can\, in turn
 \, be used to build one-shot signatures and other useful quantum primitives
 ).<br><br>Online talk. <br> <br>*This work won the TQC 2023 Outstanding Pap

DESCRIPTION:<span>We show an area law in the mutual information for the max
 imally-mixed state $\\Omega$ in the ground space of general Hamiltonians\, 
 which is independent of the underlying ground space degeneracy. Our result 
 assumes the existence of a `good' approximation to the ground state project
 or (a good AGSP)\, a crucial ingredient in former area-law proofs. Such app
 roximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians a
 nd 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians. As a corollar
 y\, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians\, for any $\\eps&gt\;0$ an
 d any bi-partition $L\\cup L^c$ of the system\, \\begin{align*} I^\\eps_max

 then conclude $I(L:L^c)_\\Omega \\le \\bigO{\\log(|L|)}$ -- an area law for
  the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In add
 ition\, we show that $\\Omega$ can be approximated up to an $\\eps$ in trac
 e norm with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\\poly(|L|/\\eps)$. Similar
  corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free 
 locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<span>The entropy accumulation theorem\, and its subsequent gen
 eralized version\, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many devi
 ce-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However\, it ha
 s the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily op
 timal\, and furthermore\, it relies on the construction of an affine min-tr
 adeoff function\, which in practice can often be challenging to construct o
 ptimally. In this work\, we address both of these challenges simultaneously
  by deriving a new entropy-accumulation bound. Our bound yields significant
 ly better finite-size performance\, and can be computed as a convex optimiz
 ation without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermo
 re\, it can be applied directly at the level of Rényi entropies if desired\
 , yielding fully-Rényi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on e
 laborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the framework o
 f quantum probability estimation\, and in the process we obtain some new re
 sults with respect to the latter framework as well.</span>

DESCRIPTION:The recent MIP*=RE theorem of Ji\, Natarajan\, Vidick\, Wright\
 , and Yuen shows that the complexity class MIP* of multiprover proof system
 s with entangled provers contains all recursively enumerable languages. Pri
 or work of Grilo\, Slofstra\, and Yuen [FOCS '19] further shows (via a tech
 nique called simulatable codes) that every language in MIP* has a perfect z
 ero knowledge (PZK) MIP* protocol. The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-
 round proof systems\, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However
 \, the construction in Grilo\, Slofstra\, and Yuen uses six provers\, and t
 here is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via s
 imulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZ
 K MIP* protocols for all of MIP*? In this paper\, we show that every langua
 ge in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK MIP* protocol\, answering the que
 stion in the affirmative. For the proof\, we use a new method based on a ke
 y consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem\, which is that every MIP* protocol ca
 n be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games
 . This makes it possible to work with MIP* protocols as boolean constraint 
 systems\, and in particular allows us to use a variant of a construction du
 e to Dwork\, Feige\, Kilian\, Naor\, and Safra [Crypto '92] which gives a c
 lassical MIP protocol for 3SAT with perfect zero knowledge. To show quantum
  soundness of this classical construction\, we develop a toolkit for analyz
 ing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games\, which we expect to 
 be useful more broadly. This toolkit also applies to commuting operator str
 ategies\, and our argument shows that every language with a commuting opera
 tor BCS protocol has a two prover PZK commuting operator protocol.

DESCRIPTION:<span>Secret sharing allows a user to split a secret into many 
 shares so that the secret can be recovered if\, and only if\, an authorized
  set of shares is collected. Although secret sharing typically does not req
 uire any computational hardness assumptions\, its security does require tha
 t an adversary cannot collect an authorized set of shares. Over long period
 s of time where an adversary can benefit from multiple data breaches\, this
  may not be a realistic assumption. We initiate the systematic study of sec
 ret sharing with certified deletion in order to achieve security even again
 st an adversary that eventually collects an authorized set of shares. In se
 cret sharing with certified deletion\, a (classical) secret is split into q
 uantum shares which can be verifiably destroyed. We define two natural noti
 ons of security: no-signaling security and adaptive security. Next\, we sho
 w how to construct (i) a secret sharing scheme with no-signaling certified 
 deletion for any monotone access structure\, and (ii) a threshold secret sh
 aring scheme with adaptive certified deletion. Our first construction uses 
 Bartusek and Khurana's (CRYPTO 2023) 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme with 
 certified deletion as a building block\, while our second construction is b
 uilt from scratch and requires several new technical ideas. For example\, w
 e significantly generalize the ``XOR extractor'' of Agarwal\, Bartusek\, Kh
 urana\, and Kumar (EUROCRYPT 2023) in order to obtain high rate seedless ex
 traction from certain quantum sources of entropy.</span>

DESCRIPTION:The solution of large systems of nonlinear differential equatio
 ns is needed for many applications in science and engineering. In this stud
 y\, we present three main improvements to existing quantum algorithms based
  on the Carleman linearisation technique. First\, by using a high-precision
  technique for the solution of the linearised differential equations\, we a
 chieve logarithmic dependence of the complexity on the error and near-linea
 r dependence on time. Second\, we demonstrate that a rescaling technique ca
 n considerably reduce the cost\, which would otherwise be exponential in th
 e Carleman order for a system of ODEs\, preventing a quantum speedup for PD
 Es. Third\, we provide improved\, tighter bounds on the error of Carleman l
 inearisation. We show that providing a stability criterion independent of t
 he discretisation can conflict with the use of the rescaling due to the dif
 ference between the max-norm and 2-norm.

DESCRIPTION:Problems based on the structure of graphs --- for example findi
 ng cliques\, independent sets\, or colourings --- are of fundamental import
 ance in classical complexity. Defining well-formulated decision problems fo
 r quantum graphs\, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs\, 
 presents several technical challenges. Consequently\, the connections betwe
 en quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored. In this work\, we
  introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach ut
 ilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels.
  The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels induced by c
 ircuits\, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We show
  that when quantifying over all channels\, this problem is complete for QMA
 (2)\; in fact\, it remains QMA(2)-complete when restricted to channels that
  are probabilistic mixtures of entanglement-breaking and partial trace chan
 nels. Quantifying over a subset of entanglement-breaking channels\, this pr
 oblem becomes QMA-complete\, and restricting further to deterministic or cl
 assical noisy channels gives rise to complete problems for NP and MA\, resp
 ectively. In this way\, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose nat
 ural quantisation is QMA(2)\, rather than QMA\, and provide the first probl
 em that allows for a direct comparison of the classes QMA(2)\, QMA\, MA\, a
 nd NP by quantifying over increasingly larger families of instances. We use
  methods that are inspired by self-testing to provide a direct proof of QMA
 (2)-completeness\, rather than reducing to a previously-studied complete pr
 oblem. We also give a new proof of the celebrated reduction of QMA(k) to QM
 A(2). In parallel\, we study a version of the closely-related independent s
 et problem for quantum graphs\, and provide preliminary evidence that it ma
 y be in general weaker in complexity\, contrasting to the classical case.

DESCRIPTION:<span>First-quantized plane-wave representations provide a very
  promising approach for quantum algorithms for solid state materials. Pseud
 opotentials provide a method of further reducing the complexity by avoiding
  the need to simulate highly localized core orbitals. The complicated funct
 ional form of pseudopotentials constitutes a major challenge for the design
  of quantum algorithms. In this work we provide new techniques to efficient
 ly implement pseudopotentials in quantum algorithms\, with orders of magnit
 ude improvement in complexity. Our methods include a high-accuracy QROM int
 erpolation of the exponential function\, combined with QROM for the pseudop
 otential parameters and coherent arithmetic. Moreover\, we generalize prior
  methods to enable the simulation of materials defined by non-cubic unit ce
 lls. Finally\, we combine these techniques to estimate the resources for bl
 ock encoding required for simulating commercially relevant instances of het
 erogeneous catalysis.</span>

 O(log N) in this model\, however\, every interactive randomized protocol ha

DESCRIPTION:Tensor network states provide successful descriptions of strong
 ly correlated quantum systems with applications ranging from condensed matt
 er physics to cosmology. Any family of tensor network states possesses an u
 nderlying entanglement structure given by a graph of maximally entangled st
 ates along the edges that identify the indices of the tensors to be contrac
 ted. Recently\, more general tensor networks have been considered\, where t
 he maximally entangled states on edges are replaced by multipartite entangl
 ed states on plaquettes. Both the structure of the underlying graph and the
  dimensionality of the entangled states influence the computational cost of
  contracting these networks. Using the geometrical properties of entangled 
 states\, we provide a method to construct tensor network representations wi
 th smaller effective bond dimension. We illustrate our method with the reso
 nating valence bond state on the kagome lattice.

DESCRIPTION:Analog quantum simulation is a promising path towards solving c
 lassically intractable problems in many-body physics on near-term quantum d
 evices. However\, the presence of noise limits the size of the system and t
 he length of time that can be simulated. In our work\, we consider an error
  model in which the actual Hamiltonian of the simulator differs from the ta
 rget Hamiltonian we want to simulate by small local perturbations\, which a
 re assumed to be random and unbiased. We analyze the error accumulated in o
 bservables in this setting and show that\, due to stochastic error cancella
 tion\, with high probability the error scales as the square root of the num
 ber of qubits instead of linearly. We explore the concentration phenomenon 
 of this error as well as its implications for local observables in the ther
 modynamic limit. Moreover\, we show that stochastic error cancellation also
  manifests in the fidelity between the target state at the end of time-evol
 ution and the actual state we obtain in the presence of noise. This indicat
 es that\, to reach a certain fidelity\, more noise can be tolerated than im
 plied by the worst-case bound if the noise comes from many statistically in
 dependent sources.

DESCRIPTION:We study 'Merlinized' versions of the recently defined Guided L
 ocal Hamiltonian problem\, which we call 'Guidable Local Hamiltonian' probl
 ems. Unlike their guided counterparts\, these problems do not have a guidin
 g state provided as a part of the input\, but merely come with the promise 
 that one exists. We consider in particular two classes of guiding states: t
 hose that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum circuit\; and those belo
 nging to a class of quantum states we call classically evaluatable\, for wh
 ich it is possible to efficiently compute expectation values of local obser
 vables classically. We show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for bo
 th classes of guiding states are 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠-complete in the inverse-polynomia
 l precision setting\, but lie within 𝖭𝖯 (or 𝖭𝗊𝖯) in the constant preci
 sion regime when the guiding state is classically evaluatable.\nOur complet
 eness results show that\, from a complexity-theoretic perspective\, classic
 al Ansätze selected by classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum
  Ansätze prepared by quantum heuristics\, as long as one has access to quan
 tum phase estimation. In relation to the quantum PCP conjecture\, we (i) de
 fine a complexity class capturing quantum-classical probabilistically check
 able proof systems and show that it is contained in BQP^NP[1] for constant 
 proof queries\; (ii) give a no-go result on 'dequantizing' the known quantu
 m reduction which maps a 𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖯-verification circuit to a local Hamiltoni
 an with constant promise gap\; (iii) give several no-go results for the exi
 stence of quantum gap amplification procedures that preserve certain ground
  state properties\; and (iv) propose two conjectures that can be viewed as 
 stronger versions of the NLTS theorem. Finally\, we show that many of our r
 esults can be directly modified to obtain similar results for the class 𝖬
 𝖠.

 ynomial quantum advantages. If one reads the popular press\, one might get 
 the impression that most efforts are directed toward finding quantum advant
 ages in applications such as optimization\, machine learning\, or quantum s
 imulation. But if we are honest\, we do not yet know as much as we would li

 g several lines. This includes quantum algorithms for machine learning\, co
 mbinatorial optimization\, quantum systems identification—such as in the ab
 elian hidden subgroup problem—and quantum simulation. We will see how the l
 atter can even challenge fundamental concepts in physics\, such as quantum 
 chaos. We will conclude the talk by emphasizing the need to bridge the sign

 lt-tolerant quantum computers.

DESCRIPTION:Stopping power is the rate at which a material absorbs the kine
 tic energy of a charged particle passing through it -- one of many properti
 es needed over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in modeling inertia
 l fusion implosions. First-principles stopping calculations are classically
  challenging because they involve the dynamics of large electronic systems 
 far from equilibrium\, with accuracies that are particularly difficult to c
 onstrain and assess in the warm-dense conditions preceding ignition. Here\,
  we describe a protocol for using a fault-tolerant quantum computer to calc
 ulate stopping power from a first-quantized representation of the electrons
  and projectile. Our approach builds upon the electronic structure block en
 codings of Su et al. [PRX Quantum 2\, 040332 2021]\, adapting and optimizin
 g those algorithms to estimate observables of interest from the non-Born-Op
 penheimer dynamics of multiple particle species at finite temperature. We a
 lso work out the constant factors associated with a novel implementation of
  a high-order Trotter approach to simulating a grid representation of these
  systems. Ultimately\, we report logical qubit requirements and leading-ord
 er Toffoli costs for computing the stopping power of various projectile/tar
 get combinations relevant to interpreting and designing inertial fusion exp
 eriments. We estimate that scientifically interesting and classically intra
 ctable stopping power calculations can be quantum simulated with roughly th
 e same number of logical qubits and about one hundred times more Toffoli ga
 tes than is required for state-of-the-art quantum simulations of industrial
 ly relevant molecules such as FeMoco or P450.

 s/2301.11340</a>        <br> <br>The design of quantum protocols for secure
  key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand\, they need to be pr
 actical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand\, their the
 oretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof ag
 ainst all possible attacks. Often\, these two requirements are in conflict 
 with each other\, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemp
 lifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current 
 optical telecommunication technology\, which\, for this protocol\, comes at
  the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. 
 After about 20 years since its invention\, this work presents the first ful
 l security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks\, including finite-size
  effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory\, q
 uantum optics\, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD pro
 tocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that
  security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protoco
 l. In addition\, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are\, in
  fact\, stronger than collective attacks.

DESCRIPTION:The optimal control problem for open quantum systems can be for
 mulated as a time- dependent Lindbladian that is parameterized by a number 
 of time-dependent control variables. Given an observable and an initial sta
 te\, the goal is to tune the control variables so that the expected value o
 f some observable with respect to the final state is maximized. In this pap
 er\, we present algorithms for solving this optimal control problem efficie
 ntly\, i.e.\, having a poly-logarithmic dependency on the system dimension\
 , which is exponentially faster than best-known classical algorithms. Our a
 lgorithms are hybrid\, consisting of both quantum and classical components.
  The quantum procedure simulates time-dependent Lindblad evolution that dri
 ves the initial state to the final state\, and it also provides access to t
 he gradients of the objective function via quantum gradient estimation. The
  classical procedure uses the gradient information to update the control va
 riables. At the technical level\, we provide the first (to the best of our 
 knowledge) simulation al- gorithm for time-dependent Lindbladians with an ℓ
 1-norm dependence. As an alternative\, we also present a simulation algorit
 hm in the interaction picture to improve the algorithm for the cases where 
 the time-independent component of a Lindbladian dominates the time-dependen
 t part. On the classical side\, we heavily adapt the state-of-the-art class
 ical optimization analysis to interface with the quantum part of our algori
 thms. Both the quantum simulation techniques and the classical optimization
  analyses might be of independent interest

DESCRIPTION:We present a computational problem with the following propertie
 s: (i) Every instance can be solved with near-certainty by a constant-depth
  quantum circuit using only nearest-neighbor gates in 3D\, even when its im
 plementation is corrupted by noise. (ii) Any constant-depth classical circu
 it composed of unbounded fan-in AND\, OR\, as well as NOT gates\, i.e.\, an
  AC0-circuit\, of size smaller than a certain subexponential\, fails to sol
 ve a uniformly random instance with probability greater than a certain cons
 tant. Such an advantage against unbounded fan-in classical circuits was pre
 viously only known in the noise-free case or when ignoring locality constra
 ints. By overcoming these limitations\, we are thus proposing the strongest
  unconditional\, fault-tolerant quantum-advantage demonstration to date. Su
 bexponential circuit-complexity lower bounds have traditionally been referr
 ed to as exponential. We use the term colossal since our fault-tolerant 3D 
 architecture resembles a certain Roman monument.

 s/2207.11781</a>        <br> <br>Quantum computers promise to dramatically 
 outperform their classical counterparts. However\, the non-classical resour
 ces enabling such computational advantages are challenging to pinpoint\, as
  it is not a single resource but the subtle interplay of many that can be h
 eld responsible for these potential advantages. In this work\, we show that
  every bosonic quantum computation can be recast into a continuous-variable
  sampling computation where all computational resources are contained in th
 e input state. Using this reduction\, we derive a general classical algorit
 hm for the strong simulation of bosonic computations\, whose complexity sca
 les with the non-Gaussian stellar rank of both the input state and the meas
 urement setup. We further study the conditions for an efficient classical s
 imulation of the associated continuous-variable sampling computations and i
 dentify an operational notion of non-Gaussian entanglement based on the lac
 k of passive separability\, thus clarifying the interplay of bosonic quantu
 m computational resources such as squeezing\, non-Gaussianity and entanglem
 ent.

DESCRIPTION:Channel capacities quantify the optimal rates of sending inform
 ation reliably over noisy channels. Usually\, the study of capacities assum
 es that the circuits which sender and receiver use for encoding and decodin
 g consist of perfectly noiseless gates. In the case of communication over q
 uantum channels\, however\, this assumption is widely believed to be unreal
 istic\, even in the long-term\, due to the fragility of quantum information
 \, which is affected by the process of decoherence. Christandl and Müller-H
 ermes have therefore initiated the study of fault-tolerant channel coding f
 or quantum channels\, i.e. coding schemes where encoder and decoder circuit
 s are affected by noise\, and have used techniques from fault-tolerant quan
 tum computing to establish coding theorems for sending classical and quantu
 m information in this scenario. Here\, we extend these methods to the case 
 of entanglement-assisted communication\, in particular proving that the fau
 lt-tolerant capacity approaches the usual capacity when the gate error appr
 oaches zero. A main tool\, which might be of independent interest\, is the 
 introduction of fault-tolerant entanglement distillation. We furthermore fo
 cus on the modularity of the techniques used\, so that they can be easily a
 dopted in other fault-tolerant communication scenarios.<table><tbody><tr><t

DESCRIPTION:The polynomial and the adversary methods are the two main tools
  for proving lower bounds on query complexity of quantum algorithms. Both m
 ethods have found a large number of applications\, some problems more suita
 ble for one method\, some for the other. It is known though that the advers
 ary method\, in its general negative-weighted version\, is tight for bounde
 d-error quantum algorithms\, whereas the polynomial method is not. By the t
 ightness of the former\, for any polynomial lower bound\, there ought to ex
 ist a corresponding adversary lower bound. However\, direct reduction was n
 ot known. In this paper\, we give a simple and direct reduction from the po
 lynomial method (in the form of a dual polynomial) to the adversary method.
  This shows that any lower bound in the form of a dual polynomial is actual
 ly an adversary lower bound of a specific form.

DESCRIPTION:Magic states\, pivotal for universal quantum computation via cl
 assically simulable Clifford gates\, often undergo decomposition into resou
 rceless stabilizer states\, facilitating simulation through classical means
 . This approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer 
 rank\, fidelity\, and extent. We extend these methods to encompass Matchgat
 e circuits (MGCs). We begin with an investigation into the algebraic constr
 aints defining Gaussian states\, marking the first explicit characterisatio
 n of these states. The explicit description of Gaussian states is pivotal t
 o our methods for tackling all the simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry
  is the concept of Gaussian rank -- a pivotal metric defining the minimum t
 erms required for decomposing a quantum state into Gaussian constituents. T
 his metric holds paramount significance in determining the runtime of rank-
 based simulations for matchgate circuits featuring magic state inputs. The 
 absence of low-rank decompositions presents a formidable computational hurd
 le\, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We f
 ind that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4
  under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally\, our numerical ana
 lysis suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of 
 this magic state. Further\, we explore the Gaussian extent\, a convex metri
 c offering an upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multi
 plicative behaviour on 4-qubit systems\, along with initial strides towards
  proving its sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important r
 esult in that direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fideli
 ty of generic states.

DESCRIPTION:We address the following question: Given a quantum channel and 
 a quantum state which is almost a fixed point of the channel\, can we find 
 a new channel and a new state\, which are respectively close to the origina
 l ones\, such that they satisfy an exact fixed point equation? This questio
 n can be asked under many interesting constraints in which the original cha
 nnel and state are assumed to have certain structures which the new channel
  and state are supposed to satisfy as well. We answer this question in the 
 affirmative under fairly general assumptions on aforementioned structures t
 hrough a compactness argument. We then concentrate on specific structures o
 f states and channels and establish explicit bounds on the approximation er
 rors between the original- and new states and channels respectively. We fin
 d a particularly desirable form of these approximation errors for a variety
  of interesting examples\, including the structure of general quantum state
 s and general quantum channels\, unitary channels and unital channels. On t
 he other hand\, for the setup of bipartite quantum systems for which the co
 nsidered channels are demanded to act locally\, we are able to lower bound 
 the possible approximation errors. Here\, we show that these approximation 
 errors necessarily scale in terms of the dimension of the quantum system in
  an undesirable manner. We apply our results to the robustness question of 
 quantum Markov chains (QMC) and establish the following: For a tripartite q
 uantum state we show the existence of a dimension-dependent upper bound on 
 the distance to the set of QMCs\, which decays as the conditional mutual in
 formation of the state vanishes.

DESCRIPTION:We establish connections between state tomography\, pseudorando
 mness\, state synthesis lower bounds\, and classical circuit lower bounds. 
 In particular\, let C be a class of quantum states that can be prepared by 
 a non-uniform family of poly-size quantum circuits. We show that if there e
 xists an algorithm that\, given copies of a quantum state\, distinguishes w
 hether it is in C or is Haar random\, promised one of these is the case\, t
 hat uses at most O(2^{n^2}) time and 2^{n^{0.99}} samples then stateBQE is 
 not a subset of stateC. Here stateBQE = stateBQTIME[2^{O(n)}] and stateC ar
 e state synthesis complexity classes as introduced by (Rosenthal and Yuen 2
 022)\, which capture problems with classical inputs but quantum output. We 
 prove formally that efficient tomography implies an efficient distinguishin
 g algorithm\, so the ability to do sufficiently fast tomography also implie
 s state synthesis lower bounds for C. Finally\, combined with a result from
  (Rosenthal 2024)\, our result says that an O(2^{n^2})-time and 2^{n^{0.99}
 }-sample algorithm that distinguishes QAC^0_f states from Haar random impli
 es EXP is not a subset of TC^0\, which would be a monumental breakthrough i
 n classical circuit complexity. This help sheds light on why time-efficient
  learning algorithms for non-uniform quantum circuit classes has only had l
 imited and partial progress. Our work parallels results in (Arunachalam\, G
 rilo\, Gur\, Oliveira\, and Sundaram 2022) that revealed a similar connecti
 on between quantum learning of Boolean functions and circuit lower bounds f
 or classical circuit classes. For instance\, just as they constructed a nov
 el conditional pseudorandom generator secure against uniform sub-exponentia
 l-time quantum computations\, we likewise construct a conditional pseudoran
 dom state (ensemble) that is secure against uniform sub-exponential-time qu
 antum computation and which relies on the complexity theoretic assumption t
 hat PSPACE is not a subset of BQSUBEXP. We also establish circuit size hier
 archy theorems for non-uniform state synthesis and connections between stat
 e synthesis class separations and decision class separations\, which may be
  of independent interest.

DESCRIPTION:                                           <br><table><colgroup
 ></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><font>The generation and verification of quantum
  states are fundamental tasks for quantum information processing that have 
 recently been investigated by Irani\, Natarajan\, Nirkhe\, Rao and Yuen [CC
 C 2022]\, Rosenthal and Yuen [ITCS 2022]\, Metger and Yuen [QIP 2023] under
  the term “state synthesis”. This paper studies this concept from the viewp
 oint of quantum distributed computing\, and especially distributed quantum 
 Merlin-Arthur (dQMA) protocols. We first introduce a novel task\, on a line
 \, called state generation with distributed inputs (SGDI). In this task\, t
 he goal is to generate the quantum state $U\\ket{\\psi}$ at the rightmost n
 ode of the line\, where $\\ket{\\psi}$ is a quantum state given at the left
 most node and $U$ is an unitary matrix whose description is distributed ove
 r the nodes of the line. We give a dQMA protocol for SGDI and utilize this 
 protocol to construct a dQMA protocol for the Set Equality problem studied 
 by Naor\, Parter and Yogev [SODA 2020]\, and complement our protocol by sho
 wing classical lower bounds for this problem. Our second contribution is a 
 dQMA protocol\, based on a recent work by Zhu and Hayashi [Physical Review 
 A\, 2019]\, to create EPR-pairs between adjacent nodes of a network without
  quantum communication. As an application of this dQMA protocol\, we prove 
 a general result showing how to convert any dQMA protocol on an arbitrary n
 etwork into another dQMA protocol where the verification stage does not req
 uire any quantum communication.</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

DESCRIPTION:<span>Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time e
 volutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also u
 nderlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian fr
 om access to the induced time evolution. However\, no protocols to rigorous
 ly test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is in fact local were known. We inve
 stigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem\, where 
 the task is to determine whether an unknown Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or
  $\\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians\, given access to the t
 ime evolution along $H$. First\, we emphasize the importance of the chosen 
 distance measure: With respect to the operator norm\, a worst-case distance
  measure\, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\\Tilde{\\Omega}(2^
 n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\\
 Tilde{\\Omega}(2^n/\\varepsilon)$\, and even coherent testers need $\\Omega
 (2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\\Omega(2^{n/2}/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution
  time. In contrast\, when distances are measured according to the normalize
 d Frobenius norm\, corresponding to an average-case distance\, we give a sa
 mple-\, time-\, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locali
 ty testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact\, our proced
 ure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properti
 es beyond locality. Finally\, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian 
 remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance\, thereby establ
 ishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. 
 Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians\,
  demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently 
 testable even with limited quantum capabilities\, and positioning Hamiltoni
 an testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learnin
 g.</span>

DESCRIPTION:Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication primitive that
  allows a long-distance quantum channel to be built using pre-shared entang
 lement and one-way classical communication. However\, the quality of the es
 tablished channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entang
 lement. In this work\, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement f
 or the task of teleportation.  We first show how this problem can be rephra
 sed as a state discrimination problem. In this picture\, a quantitative dua
 lity between teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to
 -Bob teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense codin
 g protocol\, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the succes
 s probability in the same state discrimination problem.  One of our main re
 sults provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no adva
 ntage in one-way teleportation protocols over classical states\, thereby of
 fering a new and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem o
 f identifying such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact t
 hat bound entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation thresh
 old.  Moreover\, our established duality between teleportation and dense co
 ding can be used to show that the exact same states are unable to provide a
  non-classical advantage for dense coding as well.  We also discuss the dua
 lity from a communication capacity point of view\, deriving upper and lower
  bounds on the accessible information of a dense coding protocol in terms o
 f the fidelity of its associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of thi

 s/2305.00356</a>        <br> <br>Quantum secret sharing (QSS) allows a deal
 er to distribute a secret quantum state among a set of parties in such a wa
 y that certain authorized subsets can reconstruct the secret\, while unauth
 orized subsets obtain no information about it. Previous works on QSS for ge
 neral access structures focused solely on the existence of perfectly secure
  schemes\, and the share size of the known schemes is necessarily exponenti
 al even in cases where the access structure is computed by polynomial size 
 monotone circuits. This stands in stark contrast to the classical setting\,
  where polynomial-time computationally-secure secret sharing schemes have b
 een long known for all access structures computed by polynomial-size monoto
 ne circuits under standard hardness assumptions\, and one can even obtain s
 hares which are much shorter than the secret (which is impossible with perf
 ect security).  While QSS was introduced over twenty years ago\, previous w
 orks only considered information-theoretic privacy. In this work\, we initi
 ate the study of computationally-secure QSS and show that computational ass
 umptions help significantly in building QSS schemes\, just as in the classi
 cal case. We present a simple compiler and use it to obtain a large variety
  results: We construct polynomial-time computationally-secure QSS schemes u
 nder standard hardness assumptions for a rich class of access structures. T
 his includes many access structures for which previous results in QSS neces
 sarily required exponential share size. In fact\, we can go even further: W
 e construct QSS schemes for which the size of the quantum shares is signifi
 cantly smaller than the size of the secret. As in the classical setting\, t
 his is impossible with perfect security.  We also apply our compiler to obt
 ain results beyond computational QSS. In the information-theoretic setting\
 , we improve the share size of perfect QSS schemes for a large class of $n$
 -party access structures to $1.5^{n+o(n)}$\, improving upon best known sche
 mes and matching the best known result for general access structures in the
  classical setting. Finally\, among other things\, we study the class of ac
 cess structures which can be efficiently implemented when the quantum secre
 t sharing scheme has access to a given number of copies of the secret\, inc
 luding all such functions in $\\mathsf{P}$ and $\\mathsf{NP}$.

 s/2209.08552</a>        <br> <br>Large-scale quantum computers have the pot
 ential to hold computational capabilities beyond conventional computers for
  certain problems. However\, the physical qubits within a quantum computer 
 are prone to noise and decoherence\, which must be corrected in order to pe
 rform reliable\, fault-tolerant quantum computations. Quantum Error Correct
 ion (QEC) provides the path for realizing such computations. QEC continuous
 ly generates a continuous stream of data that decoders must process at the 
 rate it is received\, which can be as fast as 1 MHz in superconducting quan
 tum computers. A little known fact of QEC is that if the decoder infrastruc
 ture cannot keep up\, a data backlog problem is encountered and the quantum
  computer runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches to quantum 
 error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower
  as the problem size is increased\, inevitably hitting the backlog problem.
  That is: the current leading proposal for fault-tolerant quantum computati
 on is not scalable. Here\, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve a
 lmost arbitrary speed\, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our paralle
 lization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed\, lea
 ding to a slow-down of the logical clock speed. However\, the slow-down is 
 now only polynomial in code size\, averting the exponential slowdown. We nu
 merically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code\, showing n
 o noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders an
 d demonstrating the parallelization speedup. <br><br>Online talk.

DESCRIPTION:<span>We revisit the problem of characterising the complexity o
 f Quantum PAC learning\, as introduced by Bshouty and Jackson [SIAM J. Comp
 ut. 1998\, 28\, 1136–1153]. Several quantum advantages have been demonstrat
 ed in this setting\, however\, none are generic: they apply to particular c
 oncept classes and typically only work when the distribution that generates
  the data is known. In the general case\, it was recently shown by Arunacha
 lam and de Wolf [JMLR\, 19 (2018) 1-36] that quantum PAC learners can only 
 achieve constant factor advantages over classical PAC learners. We show tha
 t with a natural extension of the definition of quantum PAC learning used b
 y Arunachalam and de Wolf\, we can achieve a generic advantage in quantum l
 earning. To be precise\, for any concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ of VC dimensi
 on $d$\, we show there is an $(\\epsilon\, \\delta)$-quantum PAC learner wi
 th sample complexity \\[ O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}\\left[d+ \\lo
 g(\\frac{1}{\\delta})\\right]\\log^9(1/\\epsilon)\\right). \\] Up to polylo
 garithmic factors\, this is a square root improvement over the classical le
 arning sample complexity. We show the tightness of our result by proving an
  $\\Omega(d/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ lower bound that matches our upper bound up
  to polylogarithmic factors.</span>

DESCRIPTION:Quantum data access and quantum processing can make certain cla
 ssically intractable learning tasks feasible. However\, quantum capabilitie
 s will only be available to a select few in the near future. Thus\, reliabl
 e schemes that allow classical clients to delegate learning to untrusted qu
 antum servers are required to facilitate widespread access to quantum learn
 ing advantages. Building on a recently introduced framework of interactive 
 proof systems for classical machine learning by Goldwasser et al. (ITCS 202
 1)\, we develop a framework for classical verification of quantum learning.
  We exhibit learning problems that a classical learner cannot efficiently s
 olve on their own\, but that they can efficiently and reliably solve when i
 nteracting with an untrusted quantum prover. Concretely\, we consider the p
 roblems of agnostic learning parities and Fourier-sparse functions with res
 pect to distributions with uniform input marginal. We propose a new quantum
  data access model that we call "mixture-of-superpositions" quantum example
 s\, based on which we give efficient quantum learning algorithms for these 
 tasks. Moreover\, we prove that agnostic quantum parity and Fourier-sparse 
 learning can be efficiently verified by a classical verifier with only rand

DESCRIPTION:Quantum optical systems are typically affected by two types of 
 noise: photon loss and dephasing. Despite extensive research on each noise 
 process individually\, a comprehensive understanding of their combined effe
 ct is still lacking. A crucial problem lies in determining the values of lo
 ss and dephasing for which the resulting loss-dephasing channel is anti-deg
 radable\, implying the absence of codes capable of correcting its effect or
 \, alternatively\, capable of enabling quantum communication. A conjecture 
 in [Quantum 6\, 821 (2022)] suggested that the bosonic loss-dephasing chann
 el is anti-degradable if and only if the loss is above 50%. In this paper w
 e refute this conjecture\, specifically proving that for any value of the l
 oss\, if the dephasing is above a critical value\, then the bosonic loss-de
 phasing channel is anti-degradable. While our result identifies a large par
 ameter region where quantum communication is not possible\, we also prove t
 hat if two-way classical communication is available\, then quantum communic
 ation --- and thus quantum key distribution --- is always achievable\, even
  for high values of loss and dephasing.

 s/2211.12447</a><br> <br>The so-called welded tree problem provides an exam
 ple of a black-box problem that can be solved exponentially faster by a qua
 ntum walk than by any classical algorithm. Given the name of a special ENTR
 ANCE vertex\, a quantum walk can find another distinguished EXIT vertex usi
 ng polynomially many queries\, though without finding any particular path f
 rom ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open problem for twenty years whether 
 there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path\, or if the
  path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a na
 tural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path fro
 m ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically\, we consider algorithms that\, within eac
 h branch of their superposition\, always store a set of vertex labels that 
 form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE\, and that only provide th
 ese vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the
  possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path\, it is u
 nclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior. Our 
 no-go result suggests that\, for some problems\, quantum algorithms must ne
 cessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to outperf
 orm classical computation. <br><br><br>Online talk

 s/2209.05218</a> <br> <br>In the quest to unlock the maximum potential of q

 t strategies that can estimate incompatible parameters with best precisions
  possible. However\, it is still not known how to find practical measuremen
 ts with optimal precisions\, even for uncorrelated measurements over probe 
 states. Here\, we give a concrete way to find uncorrelated measurement stra
 tegies with optimal precisions. We solve this fundamental problem by introd
 ucing a framework of conic programming that unifies the theory of precision
  bounds for multiparameter estimates for uncorrelated and correlated measur
 ement strategies under a common umbrella. Namely\, we give precision bounds
  that arise from linear programs on various cones defined on a tensor produ
 ct space of matrices\, including a particular cone of separable matrices. S
 ubsequently\, our theory allows us to develop an efficient algorithm that c
 alculates both upper and lower bounds for the ultimate precision bound for 
 uncorrelated measurement strategies\, where these bounds can be tight. In p
 articular\, the uncorrelated measurement strategy that arises from our theo
 ry saturates the upper bound to the ultimate precision bound. Also\, we sho
 w numerically that there is a strict gap between the previous efficiently c
 omputable bounds and the ultimate precision bound.

 s/2208.02518</a>        <br> <br>Entanglement detection is essential in qua
 ntum information science and quantum many-body physics. It has been proved 
 that entanglement exists almost surely for a random quantum state\, while t
 he realizations of effective entanglement criteria usually consume exponent
 ial resources\, and efficient criteria often perform poorly without prior k
 nowledge. This fact implies a fundamental limitation might exist in the det
 ectability of entanglement. In this work\, we formalize this limitation as 
 a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness of entangl
 ement criteria via a systematic method to theoretically evaluate the detect
 ion capability of entanglement criteria. For a system coupled to an environ
 ment\, we prove that any entanglement criterion needs exponentially many ob
 servables to detect the entanglement effectively when restricted to single-
 copy operations. Otherwise\, the detection capability of the criterion will
  decay double-exponentially. Furthermore\, if multi-copy joint measurements
  are allowed\, the effectiveness of entanglement detection can be exponenti
 ally improved\, which implies a quantum advantage in entanglement detection
  problems.

DESCRIPTION:We study the quantum computational complexity of the discrete l

 c algorithms''---that is\, algorithms that do not exploit any properties of
  the group/ring encoding. We establish the generic models of quantum algori
 thms for group/ring problems as quantum analogs of their classical counterp
 arts. In these models\, we count the number of group/ring operations as com
 plexity measures. Shor's and Regev's algorithms (or their slight modificati
 ons) can be described in these models. We show the quantum complexity lower
  bounds and (almost) matching algorithms of the discrete logarithm and inte
 ger factorization in these models. * (The DL problem\, fully quantum settin
 g) We prove that any generic quantum DL algorithm must make a logarithmic n
 umber of group operations for the group size\, showing that Shor's algorith
 m that makes the logarithmic number of group operations is asymptotically o
 ptimal regarding the number of group operations. This holds even considerin
 g parallel quantum algorithms. * (The DL problem\, hybrid/memory-bounded se
 tting) We observe that some (known) variations of Shor's algorithm can take
  advantage of classical computations to reduce the number and depth of quan
 tum group operations. We establish a model for generic hybrid quantum-class
 ical algorithms and prove the matching lower bounds. We also study the memo
 ry-bounded setting and establish asymptotically tight lower bounds. We exte
 nd these results to the multiple-instance DL problem with a matching new al
 gorithm. * (Integer factorization) We give a logarithmic lower bound for th
 e order-finding algorithms\, an important step for Shor's algorithm. We als
 o prove a logarithmic lower bound for a certain generic factoring algorithm
  outputting relatively small integers\, which includes a modified version o

DESCRIPTION:The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says 
 that\, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a
  problem\, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite being a classical
  complexity class\, however\, TFNP has made a surprise appearance in the st
 udy of Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT): If a QSAT instance has a System of Di
 stinct Representatives (SDR)\, then it has a product-state solution [Lauman
 n\, Läuchli\, Moessner\, Scardicchio\, and Sondhi 2010]. Efficiently findin
 g this product-state solution\, however\, has remained elusive. In this wor
 k\, we introduce a new framework based on Weighted SDRs (WSDR)\, which amon
 g other results\, allows us to: (1) significantly simplify and extend the r

DESCRIPTION:We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of 
 $c$-coloring $\\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms\, for a w
 ide range of models of distributed computing. In particular\, we show that 
 these problems do not admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 
 \\begin{enumerate} \\item We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a 
 $c$-coloring in $\\chi$-chromatic graphs in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{\\fra
 c{1}{\\alpha}})$ rounds\, with $\\alpha = \\bigl\\lfloor\\frac{c-1}{\\chi -
  1}\\bigr\\rfloor$. \\item We prove that any distributed algorithm for this
  problem requires $\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}})$ rounds. \\end{enumerate
 } Our upper bound holds in the classical\, deterministic $\\mathsf{LOCAL}$ 
 model\, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the \\emph{non-signali
 ng} model. This model\, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014\, capt
 ures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causalit
 y\; this includes not only classical deterministic $\\mathsf{LOCAL}$ and ra
 ndomized $\\mathsf{LOCAL}$ but also $\\mathsf{quantum}$-$\\mathsf{LOCAL}$\,
  even with a pre-shared quantum state. We also show that similar arguments 
 can be used to prove that\, e.g.\, 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-co
 loring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model\, and in
  particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments a
 re purely graph-theoretic at heart\; no background on quantum information t
 heory is needed to establish the proofs.

 bs/2212.08048</a>         <br> <br>We study the counting version of the Boo
 lean satisfiability problem #SAT using the ZH-calculus\, a graphical langua
 ge originally introduced to reason about quantum circuits. Using this we fi
 nd a natural extension of #SAT which we call $latex \\#SAT_\\pm$\, where va
 riables are additionally labelled by phases\, which is GapP-complete. Using
  graphical reasoning\, we find a reduction from #SAT to $latex \\#2SAT_\\pm
 $ in the ZH-calculus. We observe that the DPLL algorithm for #2SAT can be a
 dapted to $latex \\#2SAT_\\pm$ directly and hence that Wahlstrom's $latex O
 ^*(1.2377^n)$ upper bound applies to $latex \\#2SAT_\\pm$ as well. Combinin
 g this with our reduction from #SAT to $latex \\#2SAT_\\pm$ gives us novel 
 upper bounds in terms of clauses and variables that are better than $latex 
 O^*(2^n)$ for small clause densities of $latex \\frac{m}{n} &lt\; 2.25$. Th
 is is to our knowledge the first non-trivial upper bound for #SAT that is i
 ndependent of clause size. Our algorithm improves on Dubois' upper bound fo
 r #kSAT whenever $latex \\frac{m}{n} &lt\; 1.85$ and $latex k \\geq 4$\, an
 d the Williams' average-case analysis whenever $latex \\frac{m}{n} &lt\; 1.
 21$ and $latex k \\geq 6$. We also obtain an upper bound of $latex O^*(1.17
 40^L)$ for #SAT in terms of the length of the formula\, and find an improve
 d bound on #3SAT for $latex 1.2577 &lt\; \\frac{m}{n} \\leq \\frac{7}{3}$. 
 Our results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmi
 c insights\, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus
  was intended for. In addition\, using the connection to counting problems\
 , we find a new classical simulation algorithm for quantum computations tha
 t runs in $latex O(1.38^g)$ where g is the number of gates.

DESCRIPTION:We demonstrate quantum advantage with several basic assumptions
 \, specifically based on only the existence of OWFs. We introduce inefficie
 nt-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ)\, and construct it from classica
 l bit commitments. IV-PoQ is an interactive protocol between a verifier and
  a quantum prover consisting of two phases. In the first phase\, the verifi
 er is probabilistic polynomial-time\, and it interacts with the prover. In 
 the second phase\, the verifier becomes inefficient\, and makes its decisio
 n based on the transcript of the first phase. If the prover is honest\, the
  inefficient verifier accepts with high probability\, but any classical mal
 icious prover only has a small probability of being accepted by the ineffic
 ient verifier. Our construction demonstrates the following results: (1)If o
 ne-way functions exist\, then IV-PoQ exist. (2)If distributional collision-
 resistant hash functions exist (which exist if hard-on-average problems in 
 SZK exist)\, then constant-round IV-PoQ exist. We also demonstrate quantum 
 advantage based on worst-case-hard assumptions. We define auxiliary-input I
 V-PoQ (AI-IV-PoQ) that only require that for any malicious prover\, there e
 xist infinitely many auxiliary inputs under which the prover cannot cheat. 
 We construct AI-IV-PoQ from an auxiliary-input version of commitments in a 
 similar way\, showing that (1)If auxiliary-input one-way functions exist (w
 hich exist if CZK⊈BPP)\, then AI-IV-PoQ exist. (2)If auxiliary-input collis
 ion-resistant hash functions exist (which is equivalent to PWPP⊈FBPP) or SZ
 K⊈BPP\, then constant-round AI-IV-PoQ exist.

DESCRIPTION:Can an adversary hack into our computer and steal sensitive dat
 a such as cryptographic keys? This question is almost as old as the Interne
 t and significant effort has been spent on designing mechanisms to prevent 
 and detect hacking attacks. Once quantum computers arrive\, will the situat
 ion remain the same or can we hope to live in a better world? We first cons
 ider ubiquitous side-channel attacks\, which aim to leak side information o
 n secret system components\, studied in the leakage-resilient cryptography 
 literature. Classical leakage-resilient cryptography must necessarily impos
 e restrictions on the type of leakage one aims to protect against. As a not
 able example\, the most well-studied leakage model is that of bounded leaka
 ge\, where it is assumed that an adversary learns at most L bits of leakage
  on secret components\, for some leakage bound L. Although this leakage bou
 nd is necessary\, many real-world side-channel attacks cannot be captured b
 y bounded leakage. In this work\, we design cryptographic schemes that prov
 ide guarantees against arbitrary side-channel attacks: - Using techniques f
 rom unclonable quantum cryptography\, we design several basic leakage-resil
 ient primitives\, such as public- and private-key encryption\, (weak) pseud
 orandom functions\, and digital signatures which remain secure under (polyn
 omially) unbounded classical leakage. In particular\, this leakage can be m
 uch longer than the (quantum) secret being leaked upon. In our view\, leaka
 ge is the result of observations of quantities such as power consumption an
 d hence is most naturally viewed as classical information. Notably\, the le
 akage-resilience of our schemes holds even in the stronger ``LOCC leakage''
  model where the adversary can obtain adaptive leakage for (polynomially) \
 \emph{unbounded} number of rounds. - What if the adversary simply breaks in
  and obtains unbounded quantum leakage (thus making leakage-resilience impo
 ssible)? Going beyond leakage\, what if the adversary can even tamper with 
 the data arbitrarily? We initiate the study of intrusion-detection in the q
 uantum setting\, where one would like to detect if security has been compro
 mised even in the face of an arbitrary intruder attack which can leak and t
 amper with classical as well as quantum data. We design cryptographic schem
 es supporting intrusion detection for a host of primitives such as public- 
 and private-key encryption\, digital signature\, functional encryption\, pr
 ogram obfuscation and software protection. Our schemes are based on techniq
 ues from cryptography with secure key leasing and certified deletion.

 rithms only offer full quadratic speed-ups in sample complexity over their 
 classical analogs when the trained policies satisfy some regularity conditi

DESCRIPTION:We study quantum neural networks made by parametric one-qubit g
 ates and fixed two-qubit gates in the limit of infinite width\, where the g
 enerated function is the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit obser
 vables over all the qubits. First\, we prove that the probability distribut
 ion of the function generated by the untrained network with randomly initia
 lized parameters converges in distribution to a Gaussian process whenever e
 ach measured qubit is correlated only with few other measured qubits. Then\
 , we analytically characterize the training of the network via gradient des
 cent with square loss on supervised learning problems. We prove that\, as l
 ong as the network is not affected by barren plateaus\, the trained network
  can perfectly fit the training set and that the probability distribution o
 f the function generated after training still converges in distribution to 
 a Gaussian process. Finally\, we consider the statistical noise of the meas
 urement at the output of the network and prove that a polynomial number of 
 measurements is sufficient for all the previous results to hold and that th
 e network can always be trained in polynomial time.

DESCRIPTION:We introduce the parallel reversible pebbling game on directed 
 graphs for constructing parallel quantum circuits that are efficient with r
 espect to amortized space-time complexity (equivalently named cumulative co
 mplexity (CC))\, a stronger metric than the conventional space-time complex
 ity used for parallel algorithms. Our main result is a mapping from irrever
 sible algorithms for computing a function\, to quantum algorithms for compu
 ting the function in superposition\, with just a sub-polynomial overhead in
  cumulative complexity. Thus\, to construct a CC-efficient quantum oracle f
 or a function\, it suffices to solve the simpler problem of designing a CC-
 efficient classical algorithm for the function. This transformation also al
 lows us to leverage the vast body of work on classical pebbling games for d
 eveloping parallel quantum circuits with low amortized space-time complexit
 y\, given the data-dependency graph of the problem.

DESCRIPTION:I<font><font>nthis paper\, we develop the resource theory of qu

 zerodistillable key do not exist\, we define the key cost of a quantumstate
 \, channel\, and device. We study its properties through the lensof a quant
 ity that we call the key of formation. The main result ofour paper is that 
 the regularized key of formation  equals the keycost of a quantum state. Th
 e core protocol underlying this result isprivacy dilution\,  which converts
  states containing ideal privacyinto ones with diluted privacy. Additionall
 y\, our main result followsby proving that the key of formation is an entan

  mixed-stateanalogues of pure quantum states in the domain of privacy\, and
  weprove that a number of entanglement measures are equal to each otherfor 
 these states\, similar to the case of pure entangled states. Theprivacy cos

DESCRIPTION:We make progress in understanding the relationship between lear
 ning models with access to entangled\, separable and statistical measuremen
 ts in the quantum statistical query (QSQ) model. We show the following resu
 lts. Entangled versus separable measurements: The goal is to learn an unkno
 wn f from the concept class C containing functions from {0\,1}^n to [k] giv
 en copies of a uniform superposition over |x\,f(x)>. We show that\, if T co
 pies suffice to learn f using entangled measurements\, O(nT^2) copies suffi
 ce to learn f using only separable measurements. Entangled versus statistic
 al measurements: The goal is to learn a function f in C given access to sep
 arable measurements or statistical measurements. We exhibit a concept class
  C based of degree-2 functions with exponential separation between QSQ lear
 ning and quantum learning with entangled measurements (even in the presence
  of noise). This proves the "quantum analogue" of the seminal result of Blu
 m et al. that separates classical SQ learning from classical PAC learning w
 ith classification noise. QSQ lower bounds for learning states: We introduc
 e a quantum statistical query dimension (QSD)\, and use it to give lower bo
 unds on the QSQ complexity of learning. We prove superpolynomial QSQ lower 
 bounds for testing purity of quantum states\, shadow tomography\, learning 
 coset states for the Abelian hidden subgroup problem\, degree-2 functions\,
  planted biclique states\, and learning output states of Clifford circuits 
 of depth polylog(n). We also show that an extension of QSD characterizes th
 e complexity of general search problems. Further applications: We give an u
 nconditional separation between weak and strong error mitigation and prove 
 lower bounds for learning distributions in the QSQ model. Prior works by Qu
 ek et al.\, Hinsche et al.\, and Nietner et al. proved analogous results as
 suming diagonal measurements and our work removes this assumption.

DESCRIPTION:<br>Shallow-depth quantum circuits with gates of bounded fan-in
  have been demonstrated to achieve computational advantages over shallow-de
 pth classical circuits\, even allowing for unbounded fan-in (AC0). Despite 
 their versatility\, these computational models are known to be less powerfu
 l than Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) circuits\, which serve as a natu
 ral model for neural networks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and computa
 tional capabilities. We prove that PTF circuits with a constant number of l
 ayers\, when biased (having the activation region of their gates limited)\,
  fail to solve certain computational (relational) problems that quantum cir
 cuits of constant depth can solve. Furthermore\, we prove such a separation
  for a family of problems\, one for each prime qudit dimension. We prove al
 l of these separations via correlation bounds for average-case hardness. We
  also establish a tight lower bound on the size of biased PTF circuits that
  can solve a specific relational problem *exactly*. This allows us to signi
 ficantly reduce the estimated resource requirements for potential demonstra
 tions of quantum advantage. The main challenges in this area of research ar
 ise in establishing the classical lower bounds\, and in designing non-local
  games with quantum-classical gaps in the winning strategy in order to go b
 eyond qubits to higher dimensions. To address the former\, we have formulat
 ed novel switching lemmas specifically designed for multi-output biased PTF
  circuits\, and have developed a way to assess the difficulty of deriving e
 xact solutions. Our contribution towards the latter is grounded in a novel 
 assortment of non-local games\, characterized by an exponential difference 
 between their classical and quantum success probabilities. Finally\, our te
 chnical developments could be of more general and independent interest.<br>

 ertain scenarios\, Arunachalam and de Wolf (JMLR\, 2018) proved that quantu
 m learners are asymptotically no more efficient than classical ones in the 
 quantum PAC and Agnostic learning models. They established lower bounds on 
 sample complexity via quantum state identification and Fourier analysis. In
  this paper\, we derive optimal lower bounds for quantum sample complexity 
 in both the PAC and agnostic models via an information-theoretic approach. 
 The proofs are arguably simpler\, and the same ideas can potentially be use
 d to derive optimal bounds for other problems in quantum learning theory. W

 to constant factors. First\, we show that the information-theoretic approac
 h mentioned above provably does not yield the optimal lower bound. As a by-
 product\, we get a natural ensemble of pure states in arbitrarily high dime
 nsions which are not easily (simultaneously) distinguishable\, while the en
 semble has close to maximal Holevo information. Second\, we discover that t
 he information-theoretic approach yields an asymptotically optimal bound fo
 r an approximation variant of the problem. Finally\, we derive a sharp lowe
 r bound for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem\, with the exact leading o
 rder term\, via the generalized Holevo-Curlander bounds on the distinguisha
 bility of an ensemble. All the aspects of the Quantum Coupon Collector prob
 lem we study rest on properties of the spectrum of the associated Gram matr

DESCRIPTION:<span>Understanding and approximating extremal energy states of
  local Hamiltonians is a central problem in quantum physics and complexity 
 theory. Recent work has focused on developing approximation algorithms for 
 local Hamiltonians\, and in particular the ``Quantum Max Cut'' (QMaxCut) pr
 oblem\, which is closely related to the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model.
  In this work\, we introduce a family of semidefinite programming (SDP) rel
 axations based on the Navascues-Pironio-Acin (NPA) hierarchy which is tailo
 red for QMaxCut by taking into account its SU(2) symmetry. We show that the
  hierarchy converges to the optimal QMaxCut value at a finite level\, which
  is based on a characterization of the algebra of SWAP operators. We give s
 everal analytic proofs and computational results showing exactness/inexactn
 ess of our hierarchy at the lowest level on several important families of g
 raphs. We also discuss relationships between SDP approaches for QMaxCut and
  frustration-freeness in condensed matter physics and numerically demonstra
 te that the SDP-solvability practically becomes an efficiently-computable g
 eneralization of frustration-freeness. Furthermore\, by numerical demonstra
 tion we show the potential of SDP algorithms to perform as an approximate m
 ethod to compute physical quantities and capture physical features of some 
 Heisenberg-type statistical mechanics models even away from the frustration
 -free regions.</span>

DESCRIPTION:Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting targe
 t state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-toler
 ant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state pu
 rification\, we develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol\, w
 hich consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purificatio
 n but offers up to exponentially stronger error suppression with increased 
 system size and more noisy operation copies. Furthermore\, VCP removes most
  of the assumptions required in virtual state purification. Essentially\, V
 CP is the first quantum error mitigation protocol that does not require spe
 cific knowledge about the noise models\, the target quantum state\, and the
  target problem while still offering rigorous performance guarantees for pr
 actical noise regimes. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum
  error correction to produce one of the first protocols that combine quantu
 m error correction and quantum error mitigation beyond concatenation. We ca
 n remove all noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost 
 as low-order purification\, reaching beyond the standard bias-variance trad
 e-off in quantum error mitigation. Our protocol can also be adapted to key 
 tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement
  distribution.

DESCRIPTION:<span>We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a co
 rrelation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at 
 most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of
  the conditional mutual information defined through the so-called Belavkin-
 Staszewski relative entropy. Our main result is the superexponential decay 
 of various such measures\, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamilto
 nian is translation-invariant. We use a recovery map associated with these 
 definitions to sequentially construct tensor network approximations in term
 s of marginals of small (sub-logarithmic) size. This allows for representat
 ions of the state that can be learned efficiently from local measurements. 
 We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity\, from 
 which it follows that the purity of the entire Gibbs state can be efficient
 ly estimated to a small multiplicative error. As a technical step of indepe
 ndent interest\, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Stasze
 wski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.</s

DESCRIPTION:Quantum state purification is the functionality that\, given mu
 ltiple copies of an unknown state\, outputs a state with increased purity. 
 This is an essential building block for the near- and middle-term quantum e
 cosystems before the availability of full fault tolerance\, where one may w
 ant to obtain purified quantum states instead of expectation values. We pro
 pose an effective state purification gadget with a moderate quantum overhea
 d by projecting multiple noisy quantum inputs to their symmetry subspace de
 fined by a set of projectors forming a subgroup of the symmetry group. This
  provides a state purification performance scaling inverse-linearly to the 
 number of state copies given a fixed stochastic error rate\, which drastica
 lly improves the implementation overhead in previous works. Our method may 
 find its application in designing robust verification protocols for quantum
  outputs before the availability of fully fault-tolerant computing.

DESCRIPTION:<span>We present a framework for quantum computation\, similar 
 to Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC)\, that is based on the quantum Zeno 
 effect. By performing randomised dephasing operations at intervals determin
 ed by a Poisson process\, we are able to track the eigenspace associated to
  a particular eigenvalue. We derive a simple differential equation for the 
 fidelity leading to general theorems bounding the time complexity of a whol
 e class of algorithms. We also use eigenstate filtering to optimise the sca
 ling of the complexity in the error tolerance ε. In many cases the bounds g
 iven by our general theorems are optimal\, giving a time complexity of O(1/
 Δ) with Δ the minimum of the gap. This allows us to prove optimal results u
 sing very general features of problems\, minimising the amount of problem-s
 pecific insight necessary. As two applications of our framework we obtain o
 ptimal scaling for the Grover problem (i.e. O(N^1/2) where N is the databas
 e size) and the Quantum Linear System Problem (i.e. O(κ\\log(1/ε)) where κ 
 is the condition number and ε the error tolerance) by direct applications o

DESCRIPTION:We study the impact of non-unital noise on random quantum circu
 its\, generalizing many previous results about the impact of noise on near-
 term computation that assumed that noise was unital or even specifically de
 polarizing. Non-unital noise (a class that includes amplitude damping noise
  and other loss processes) is a more natural noise model for certain physic
 al platforms than unital noise. Yet it is analytically more challenging and
  has in the past led to starkly different conclusions about computational t
 asks\, like error correction and random circuit sampling. Our main result i
 s that non-unital noise ``truncates" deep random quantum circuits to effect
 ively have logarithmic depth\, in the task of computing Pauli expectation v
 alues. By way of proving this\, we contribute a contraction result for quan
 tum circuits under non-unital noise\, which significantly strengthens all p
 revious results in this setting. As an application\, we show that circuits 
 used for variational quantum algorithms\, under non-unital noise\, avoid th
 e problem of barren plateaus for cost functions made of local observables. 
 This is not necessarily good news\, however\, as their effective shallownes
 s also makes such circuits vulnerable to classical simulators. Accordingly\
 , we also provide an algorithm to estimate local expectation values in the 
 presence of non-unital noise\, that succeeds with high probability over the
  ensemble. The runtime of our algorithm is independent of both the number o
 f qubits and circuit depth\, and depends polynomially on the accuracy for o
 ne-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomially for two-dimensional one
 s. While the hardness of sampling from random circuits under non–unital noi
 se is yet unresolved\, our results indicate that for the vast majority of q
 uantum circuits under non-unital noise\, we are unlikely to glean quantum a
 dvantage for algorithms that output expectation values.

DESCRIPTION:We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LC
 Ls) from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have be
 en studied recently\, including the quantum-LOCAL model\, finitely-dependen
 t processes\, non-signaling model\, dynamic-LOCAL model\, and online-LOCAL 
 model [e.g. STOC 2024\, ICALP 2023]. First\, we demonstrate the advantage t
 hat finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We sh
 ow that all LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\\log* n)$ in the LOCAL 
 model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In 
 particular\, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees\, a
 nswering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new for
 mal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not 
 possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the $\\Theta(\\log* n)
 $ complexity class by using non-signaling arguments. Second\, we put limits
  on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end\, we introduce a m
 odel called randomized online-LOCAL\, which is strong enough to simulate e.
 g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL\, and we show that it is also strong enough to 
 simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorit
 hm. We prove the following result for trees: if we can solve an LCL problem
  with locality $o(\\log^{(\\gapexp)} n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL mod
 el\, we can solve it with locality $O(\\log* n)$ in the classical determini
 stic LOCAL model. Put together\, these results show that in trees the set o
 f LCLs that can be solved with locality $O(\\log* n)$ is the same across al
 l these models: locality $O(\\log* n)$ in quantum-LOCAL\, non-signaling mod
 el\, dynamic-LOCAL\, or online-LOCAL is not stronger than locality $O(\\log
 * n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.

 s/2210.08680</a>        <br> <br>The ground state energy and the free energ
 y of Quantum Local Hamiltonians are fundamental quantities in quantum many-
 body physics\, however\, it is QMA-Hard to estimate them in general. In thi
 s paper\, we develop new techniques to find classical\, additive error prod
 uct-state approximations for these quantities on certain families of Quantu
 m $k$-Local Hamiltonians. Namely\, those which are either dense\, have low 
 threshold rank\, or are defined on a sparse graph that excludes a fixed min
 or\, building on the methods and the systems studied by Brandão and Harrow\
 , Gharibian and Kempe\, and Bansal\, Bravyi and Terhal.  We present two mai
 n technical contributions. First\, we discuss a connection between product-
 state approximations of local Hamiltonians and combinatorial graph property
  testing. We develop a series of \\textit{weak Szemer'edi regularity} lemma
 s for $k$-local Hamiltonians\, built on those of Frieze and Kannan and othe
 rs. We use them to develop \\textit{constant time} sampling algorithms\, an
 d to characterize the `vertex sample complexity' of the Local Hamiltonian p
 roblem\, in an analog to a classical result by Alon\, de la Vega\, Kannan a
 nd Karpinski. Second\, we build on the information-theoretic product-state 
 approximation techniques by Brandão and Harrow\, extending their results to
  the free energy and to an asymmetric graph setting. We leverage this struc
 ture to define families of algorithms for the free energy at low temperatur
 es\, and new algorithms for certain sparse graph families.

 s/2208.07887</a>        <br> <br>Quantum communication is often investigate
 d in scenarios where only the dimension of Hilbert space is known. However\
 , assigning a precise dimension is often an approximation of what is actual
 ly a higher-dimensional process. Here\, we introduce and investigate quantu
 m information encoded in carriers that nearly\, but not entirely\, correspo
 nd to standard qudits. We demonstrate the relevance of this concept for sem
 i-device-independent quantum information by showing how small higher-dimens
 ional components can significantly compromise the conclusions of establishe
 d protocols. Then we provide a general method\, based on semidefinite relax
 ations\, for bounding the set of almost qudit correlations\, and apply it t
 o remedy the demonstrated issues. This method also offers a novel systemati
 c approach to the well-known task of device-independent tests of classical 
 and quantum dimensions with unentangled devices. Finally\, we also consider
  viewing almost qubit systems as a physical resource available to the exper
 imenter and determine the optimal quantum protocol for the well-known Rando

 s/2210.06796</a>        <br> <br>We prove a nontrivial circuit-depth lower 
 bound for preparing a low-energy state of a locally interacting quantum man
 y-body system in two dimensions\, assuming the circuit is geometrically loc
 al. For preparing any state which has an energy density of at most $\\epsil

 plies that the lowest energy density obtainable from a large class of exist
 ing variational circuits (e.g.\, Hamiltonian variational ansatz) cannot\, i

DESCRIPTION:The existence of one-way functions is one of the most fundament
 al assumptions in classical cryptography. In the quantum world\, on the oth
 er hand\, there are evidences that some cryptographic primitives can exist 
 even if one-way functions do not exist [Kretschmer\, TQC 2021\; Morimae and
  Yamakawa\, CRYPTO 2022\; Ananth\, Qian\, and Yuen\, CRYPTO 2022]. We there
 fore have the following important open problem in quantum cryptography: Wha
 t is the most fundamental assumption in quantum cryptography? In this direc
 tion\, [Brakerski\, Canetti\, and Qian\, ITCS 2023] recently defined a noti
 on called EFI pairs\, which are pairs of efficiently generatable states tha
 t are statistically distinguishable but computationally indistinguishable\,
  and showed its equivalence with some cryptographic primitives including co
 mmitments\, oblivious transfer\, and general multi-party computations. Howe
 ver\, their work focuses on decision-type primitives and does not cover sea
 rch-type primitives like quantum money and digital signatures. In this pape
 r\, we study properties of one-way state generators (OWSGs)\, which are a q
 uantum analogue of one-way functions proposed by Morimae and Yamakawa. We f
 irst revisit the definition of OWSGs and generalize it by allowing mixed ou
 tput states. Then we show the following results. 1. We define a weaker vers
 ion of OWSGs\, which we call weak OWSGs\, and show that they are equivalent
  to OWSGs. It is a quantum analogue of the amplification theorem for classi
 cal weak one-way functions. 2. (Bounded-time-secure) quantum digital signat
 ures with quantum public keys are equivalent to OWSGs. 3. Private-key quant
 um money schemes (with pure money states) imply OWSGs. 4. Quantum pseudo on
 e-time pad schemes imply both OWSGs and EFI pairs. For EFI pairs\, single-c
 opy security suffices. 5. We introduce an incomparable variant of OWSGs\, w
 hich we call secretly-verifiable and statisticallyinvertible OWSGs\, and sh
 ow that they are equivalent to EFI pairs.

DESCRIPTION:Given a linear system of equations Ax = b\, quantum linear syst
 em solvers (QLSSs) approximately prepare a quantum state |x⟩ for which the 
 amplitudes are proportional to the solution vector x. Asymptotically optima
 l QLSSs have query complexity O(κlog(1/ε))\, where κ is the condition numbe
 r of A\, and ε is the approximation error. However\, runtime guarantees for
  existing optimal and near-optimal QLSSs do not have favorable constant fac
 tors\, in part because they rely on complex or difficult-to-analyze techniq
 ues like variable-time amplitude amplification and adiabatic path-following
 . Here\, we give a conceptually simple\, near-optimal QLSS that does not us
 e these techniques. If the solution norm ∥x∥∥A∥/∥b∥ is known exactly\, our 
 QLSS requires only a single application of kernel reflection (an extension 
 of eigenstate filtering)\, and has query complexity (1 + O(ε))κ ln(2√2/ε). 
 If the norm is not known\, it can be estimated up to a constant factor usin
 g O(log log(κ)) applications of kernel projection (a slight generalization 
 of eigenstate filtering)\, yielding a QLSS with near-optimal total complexi
 ty O(κ log log(κ) log log log(κ) + κ log(1/ε)). Preliminary constant-factor
  analysis suggests that for practical values of κ\, ε our QLSS provides rig
 orous guarantees that are at least an order of magnitude better than previo
 us guarantees.

DESCRIPTION:Decoders that provide an estimate of the probability of a logic
 al failure conditioned on the error syndrome ("soft-output decoders") can r
 educe the overhead cost of fault-tolerant quantum memory and computation. I
 n this work we construct efficient soft-output decoders for the surface cod
 e derived from the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders.
  We show that soft-output decoding can improve the performance of a "hierar
 chical code\," a concatenated scheme in which the inner code is the surface
  code\, and the outer code is a high-rate quantum low-density parity-check 
 code. Alternatively\, the soft-output decoding can improve the reliability 
 of fault-tolerant circuit sampling by flagging those runs that should be di
 scarded because the probability of a logical error is intolerably large.

DESCRIPTION:<span>The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial 
 task in quantum simulation. In this work\, we prove that an efficiently imp
 lementable dissipative evolution recently introduced by Chen et al. thermal
 izes into its equilibrium Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with sys
 tem size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a L
 ieb-Robinson bound\, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore\,
  we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purification
 s or ``thermofield double" states. To the best of our knowledge\, these are
  the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of hig
 h temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature 
 regime\, we show that implementing this family of Lindbladians for inverse 
 temperatures logarithmic in the system's size is polynomially equivalent to
  standard quantum computation. On a technical level\, for high temperatures
 \, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution int
 o a Hamiltonian and the analysis of the stability of its gap. For low tempe
 rature\, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature of the Lapla
 ce transform of the energy observable at fixed runtime\, and resort to circ
 uit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum ad
 iabatic computing. Taken together\, our results show that the family of Lin
 dbladians of Chen et al. efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many
 -body states of interest\, and have the potential to mirror the success of 
 classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.</span>

 </p><br><br>Sampling from the output distributions of quantum computations 
 comprising only commuting gates\, known as instantaneous quantum polynomial
  (IQP) computations\, is believed to be intractable for classical computers
 \, and hence this task has become a leading candidate for testing the capab
 ilities of quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP c
 ircuit undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise\, the output distribution
  can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer after a critical $O(1)$
  depth. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum supremacy tasks\, we
  do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture\, on anti-concent
 ration properties\, nor do we require $Ømega(łog(n))$ circuit depth. We tak
 e advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of diagonal ga
 tes\, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a large-sca
 le breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest that q
 uantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more susceptible 
 to classical simulation than previously thought.

DESCRIPTION:<span>The quantum analogue of the equality function\, known as 
 the quantum state identity problem\, is the task of deciding whether n unkn
 own quantum states are equal or unequal\, given the promise that all states
  are either pairwise orthogonal or identical. Under the one-sided error req
 uirement\, it is known that the permutation test is optimal for this task\,
  and for two input states this coincides with the well-known Swap test. Unt
 il now\, the optimal measurement in the general two-sided error regime was 
 unknown. Under more specific promises\, the problem can be solved approxima
 tely or even optimally with simpler tests\, such as the circle test. This w
 ork attempts to capture the underlying structure of (fine-grained formulati
 ons of) the quantum state identity problem. Using tools from semi-definite 
 programming and representation theory\, we (i) give an optimal test for any
  input distribution without the one-sided error requirement by writing the 
 problem as an SDP\, giving the exact solutions to the primal and dual progr
 ams and showing that the two values coincide\; (ii) propose a general G-tes
 t which uses an arbitrary subgroup G of S_n\, giving an analytic expression
  of the performance of the specific test\, and (iii) give an approximation 
 of the permutation test using only a classical permutation and n-1 Swap tes

 s/2206.06362</a>        <br> <br>Recently\, several quantum benchmarking al
 gorithms have been developed to characterize noisy quantum gates on today's
  quantum devices. A well-known issue in benchmarking is that not everything
  about quantum noise is learnable due to the existence of gauge freedom\, l
 eaving open the question of what information about noise is learnable and w
 hat is not\, which has been unclear even for a single CNOT gate. Here we gi
 ve a precise characterization of the learnability of Pauli noise channels a
 ttached to Clifford gates\, showing that learnable information corresponds 
 to the cycle space of the pattern transfer graph of the gate set\, while un
 learnable information corresponds to the cut space. This implies the optima
 lity of cycle benchmarking\, in the sense that it can learn all learnable i
 nformation about Pauli noise. We experimentally demonstrate noise character
 ization of IBM's CNOT gate up to 2 unlearnable degrees of freedom\, for whi
 ch we obtain bounds using physical constraints. In addition\, we give an at
 tempt to characterize the unlearnable information by assuming perfect initi

DESCRIPTION:We study the problem of binary composite channel discrimination
  in the asymmetric setting\, where the hypotheses are given by fairly arbit
 rary sets of channels\, and samples do not have to be identically distribut
 ed. In the case of quantum channels we prove: (i) a characterization of the
  Stein's exponent for parallel channel discrimination strategies and (ii) a
 n upper bound on the Stein's exponent for adaptive channel discrimination s
 trategies. We further show that already for classical channels this upper b
 ound can sometimes be achieved and be strictly larger than what is possible
  with parallel strategies. Hence\, there can be an advantage of adaptive ch
 annel discrimination strategies with composite hypotheses for classical cha
 nnels\, unlike in the case of simple hypotheses. Moreover\, we show that cl
 assically this advantage can only exist if the sets of channels correspondi
 ng to the hypotheses are non-convex. As a consequence of our more general t

DESCRIPTION:<span>In this work\, we continue the search for quantum locally
  testable codes (qLTCs) of new parameters by presenting three constructions
  that can make new qLTCs from old. The first analyses the soundness of a qu
 antum code under Hastings' weight reduction construction for qLDPC codes to
  give a weight reduction procedure for qLTCs. Secondly\, we describe a nove
 l `soundness amplification' procedure for qLTCs which can increase the soun
 dness of any qLTC to a constant while preserving its distance and dimension
 \, with an impact only felt on its locality. Finally\, we apply the AEL dis
 tance amplification construction to the case of qLTCs for the first time wh
 ich can turn a high-distance qLTC into one with linear distance\, at the ex
 pense of other parameters. These constructions can be used on as-yet undisc
 overed qLTCs to obtain new parameters\, but we also find a number of presen
 t applications to prove the existence of codes in previously unknown parame
 ter regimes. In particular\, applications of these operations to the hypers
 phere product code and the hemicubic code yield many previously unknown par
 ameters. Additionally\, soundness amplification can be used to produce the 
 first asymptotically good testable quantum code (rather than locally testab
 le) - that being one with linear distance and dimension\, as well as consta
 nt soundness. Lastly\, applications of all three results are described to a
 n upcoming work.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<p><strong><b>Potential and Limitations of Near-Term Quantum Co
 mputing</b></strong></p><p>Quantum computers promise the efficient solution
  of some highly structured computational problems that are classically intr
 actable. While for many years they have been primarily objects of theoretic
 al study\, only recently have efforts to build intermediate-scale quantum c
 omputers taken off. This creates an interesting state of affairs\, but at t
 he same time\, it begs the question of what such devices are\, practically 
 speaking\, good for. In this talk\, we will present some encouraging as wel
 l as—emphasizing the latter—discouraging insights into near-term quantum co
 mputing. We will discuss rigorous quantum advantages in paradigmatic proble
 ms [1\,2] and explore the use of quantum computers in machine learning [3\,
 4] and optimization [5]. The second part of the talk will focus on the sign
 ificant limitations that arise. We will emphasize identifying limitations t
 o quantum error mitigation for shallow quantum circuits in the worst case [
 6]. Interestingly\, it may depend on the nuances of non-unital quantum nois
 e to what extent quantum computing without error correction may be feasible
  [7]. We will also provide efficient classical algorithms for instances of 
 quantum algorithms\, hence "de-quantizing" them [7-9]. The talk will conclu
 de with the note that quantum simulation remains\, to date\, one of the mos
 t promising applications of near-term quantum devices [10\,11].<br><br>[1]

 s/2302.07040</a>        <br> <br>The Clifford+T gate set is commonly used t
 o perform universal quantum computation. In such setup the T gate is typica
 lly much more expensive to implement in a fault-tolerant way than Clifford 
 gates. To improve the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computing it is
  then crucial to minimize the number of T gates. Many algorithms\, yielding
  effective results\, have been designed to address this problem. It has bee
 n demonstrated that performing a pre-processing step consisting of reducing
  the number of Hadamard gates in the circuit can help to exploit the full p
 otential of these algorithms and thereby lead to a substantial T-count redu
 ction. Moreover\, minimizing the number of Hadamard gates also restrains th
 e number of additional qubits and operations resulting from the gadgetizati
 on of Hadamard gates\, a procedure used by some compilers to further reduce
  the number of T gates. In this work we tackle the Hadamard gate reduction 
 problem\, and propose an algorithm for synthesizing a sequence of Pauli rot
 ations with a minimal number of Hadamard gates. Based on this result\, we p
 resent an algorithm which optimally minimizes the number of Hadamard gates 
 lying between the first and the last T gate of the circuit.

  Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes\, a commonly-studied category of codes\
 , by applying a series of physical Pauli X and Z gates. Logical operators o
 f this form are fault-tolerant because each qubit is acted upon by at most 
 one gate\, limiting the spread of errors\, and are referred to as transvers

DESCRIPTION:<span>We study digital signatures with revocation capabilities 
 and show two results. First\, we define and construct digital signatures wi
 th revocable signing keys from the LWE assumption. In this primitive\, the 
 signing key is a quantum state which enables a user to sign many messages a
 nd yet\, the quantum key is also revocable\, i.e.\, it can be collapsed int
 o a classical certificate which can later be verified. Once the key is succ
 essfully revoked\, we require that the initial recipient of the key loses t
 he ability to sign. We construct digital signatures with revocable signing 
 keys from a newly introduced primitive which we call two-tier one-shot sign
 atures\, which may be of independent interest. This is a variant of one-sho
 t signatures\, where the verification of a signature for the message ``0'' 
 is done publicly\, whereas the verification for the message ``1'' is done i
 n private. We give a construction of two-tier one-shot signatures from the 
 LWE assumption. As a complementary result\, we also construct digital signa
 tures with quantum revocation from group actions\, where the quantum signin
 g key is simply ``returned'' and then verified as part of revocation. Secon
 d\, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signatures fr
 om OWFs. In this primitive\, the signer can produce quantum signatures whic
 h can later be revoked. Here\, the security property requires that\, once r
 evocation is successful\, the initial recipient of the signature loses the 
 ability to find accepting inputs to the signature verification algorithm. W
 e construct this primitive using a newly introduced two-tier variant of tok
 enized signatures. For the construction\, we show a new lemma which we call
  the adaptive hardcore bit property for OWFs\, which may enable further app
 lications.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<span>Given that reliable cloud quantum computers are becoming 
 closer to reality\, the concept of delegation of quantum computations and i
 ts verifiability is of central interest. Many models have been proposed\, e
 ach with specific strengths and weaknesses. Here\, we put forth a new model
  where the client trusts only its classical processing\, makes no computati
 onal assumptions\, and interacts with a quantum server in a single round. I
 n addition\, during a set-up phase\, the client specifies the size $n$ of t
 he computation and receives an untrusted\, off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum devi
 ce that is used to report the outcome of a single measurement. We show how 
 to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS model. This als
 o yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA\, which\, furthermore\,
  we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This provides t
 he first relativistic (one-round)\, two-prover zero-knowledge proof system 
 for QMA. As a proof approach\, we provide a new self-test for n EPR pairs u
 sing only constant-sized Pauli measurements\, and show how it provides a ne
 w avenue for the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verificatio
 n. Along the way\, we also provide an enhanced version of a well-known stab
 ility result due to Gowers and Hatami and show how it completes a common ar
 gument used in self-testing.</span>

DESCRIPTION:Nonlocal games are a foundational tool for understanding entang
 lement and constructing quantum protocols in settings with multiple spatial
 ly separated quantum devices. In this work\, we continue the study initiate
 d by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) of compiled nonlocal games\, played between a 
 classical verifier and a single cryptographically limited quantum device. O
 ur main result is that the compiler proposed by Kalai et al. is sound for a
 ny two-player XOR game. A celebrated theorem of Tsirelson shows that for XO
 R games\, the quantum value is exactly given by a semidefinite program\, an
 d we obtain our result by showing that the SDP upper bound holds for the co
 mpiled game up to a negligible error arising from the compilation. This ans
 wers a question raised by Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23)\, who showed sound
 ness for the specific case of the CHSH game. Using our techniques\, we obta
 in several additional results\, including (1) tight bounds on the compiled 
 value of parallel-repeated XOR games\, (2) operator self-testing statements
  for any compiled XOR game\, and (3) a "nice" sum-of-squares certificate fo
 r any XOR game\, from which operator rigidity is manifest.

 s/2302.14755</a>        <br> <br>The recently-defined No Low-energy Samplea
 ble States (NLSS) conjecture of Gharibian and Le Gall [GL22] posits the exi
 stence of a family of local Hamiltonians where all states of low-enough con
 stant energy do not have succinct representations allowing perfect sampling
  access. States that can be prepared using only Clifford gates (i.e. stabil
 izer states) are an example of sampleable states\, so the NLSS conjecture i
 mplies the existence of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy space contains 
 no stabilizer states. We describe families that exhibit this requisite prop
 erty via a simple alteration to local Hamiltonians corresponding to CSS cod
 es. Our method can also be applied to the recent NLTS Hamiltonians of Anshu
 \, Breuckmann\, and Nirkhe [ABN22]\, resulting in a family of local Hamilto

DESCRIPTION:We consider random quantum circuits (RQC) on arbitrary connecte
 d graphs whose edges determine the allowed 2-qudit interactions. Prior work
  has established that such $n$-qudit circuits with local dimension $q$ on 1
 D\, complete\, and $D$-dimensional graphs form approximate unitary designs\
 , that is\, they generate unitaries from distributions close to the Haar me
 asure on the unitary group $U(q^n)$ after polynomially many gates. Here\, w
 e extend those results by proving that RQCs comprised of $O(poly(n\,k))$ ga
 tes on a wide class of graphs form approximate unitary $k$-designs. We prov
 e that RQCs on graphs with spanning trees of bounded degree and height form
  $k$-designs after $O(|E|n\\ {\\rm poly}(k))$ gates\, where $|E|$ is the nu
 mber of edges in the graph. Furthermore\, we identify larger classes of gra
 phs for which RQCs generate approximate designs in polynomial circuit size.
  For $k \\leq 4$\, we show that RQCs on graphs of certain maximum degrees f
 orm designs after $O(|E|n)$ gates\, providing explicit constants. We determ
 ine our circuit size bounds from the spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. T
 o that end\, we extend the finite-size (or Knabe) method for bounding gaps 
 of frustration-free Hamiltonians on regular graphs to arbitrary connected g
 raphs. We further introduce a new method based on the Detectability Lemma f
 or determining the spectral gaps of Hamiltonians on arbitrary graphs. Our m
 ethods have wider applicability as the first method provides a succinct alt
 ernative proof of [Commun. Math. Phys. 291\, 257 (2009)] and the second met
 hod proves that RQCs on any connected architecture form approximate designs
  in quasi-polynomial circuit size.

DESCRIPTION:<span>The ability of quantum computers to directly manipulate a
 nd analyze quantum states stored in quantum memory allows them to learn abo
 ut aspects of our physical world that would otherwise be invisible given a 
 modest number of measurements. Here we investigate a new learning resource 
 which could be available to quantum computers in the future – measurements 
 on the unknown state accompanied by its complex conjugate ρ⊗ρ*. For a certa
 in shadow tomography task\, we surprisingly find that measurements on only 
 copies of ρ⊗ρ* can be exponentially more powerful than measurements on ρ⊗K\
 , even for large K. This expands the class of exponential advantages using 
 only a constant overhead quantum memory\, or minimal quantum memory\, and w
 e provide a number of examples where the state ρ* is naturally available in
  both computational and physical applications. In addition\, we precisely q
 uantify the power of classical shadows on single copies under a generalized
  Clifford ensemble and give a class of quantities that can be efficiently l
 earned. The learning task we study in both the single copy and quantum memo
 ry is physically natural and corresponds to real-space observables with a l
 imit of bosonic modes\, where it achieves an exponential improvement in det
 ecting certain signals under a noisy background. In addition to quantifying
  a fundamentally new and powerful resource in quantum learning\, we believe
  the advantage may find applications in improving quantum simulation\, lear
 ning from quantum sensors\, and uncovering new physical phenomena.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<span>A set of classical or quantum states is equivalent to ano
 ther one if there exists a pair of classical or quantum channels mapping ei
 ther set to the other one. For dichotomies (pairs of states)\, this is clos
 ely connected to (classical or quantum) Rényi divergences (RD) and the data
 -processing inequality: If a RD remains unchanged when a channel is applied
  to the dichotomy\, then there is a recovery channel mapping the image back
  to the initial dichotomy. Here\, we prove for classical dichotomies that e
 quality of the RDs alone is already sufficient for the existence of a chann
 el in any of the two directions and discuss some applications. In the quant
 um case\, all families of quantum RDs are seen to be insufficient because t
 hey cannot detect anti-unitary transformations. Thus\, including anti-unita
 ries\, we pose the problem of finding a sufficient family. It is shown that
  the Petz and maximal quantum RD are still insufficient in this more genera
 l sense and we provide evidence for sufficiency of the minimal quantum RD. 
 As a side result of our techniques\, we obtain an infinite list of inequali
 ties fulfilled by the classical\, the Petz quantum\, and the maximal quantu
 m RDs. These inequalities are not true for the minimal quantum RDs. Our res
 ults further imply that any sufficient set of conditions for state transiti
 ons in the resource theory of athermality must be able to detect time-rever
 sal.</span>

DESCRIPTION:We give an oracle separation between QMA and QCMA for quantum a
 lgorithms that have bounded adaptivity in their oracle queries\; that is\, 
 the number of rounds of oracle calls is small\, though each round may invol
 ve polynomially many queries in parallel. Our oracle construction is a simp
 lified version of the construction used recently by Li\, Liu\, Pelecanos\, 
 and Yamakawa (2023)\, who showed an oracle separation between QMA and QCMA 
 when the quantum algorithms are only allowed to access the oracle classical
 ly. To prove our results\, we introduce a property of relations called slip
 periness\, which may be useful for getting a fully general classical oracle
  separation between QMA and QCMA.

 s/2304.06735</a>        <br> <br>The process matrix framework models quantu
 m protocols without assuming a definite acyclic causal order between the op
 erations of parties in the protocol. This leads to so-called indefinite cau
 sal order processes which have been shown to provide advantages for quantum
  information processing. However\, there have been longstanding open questi
 ons regarding the subset of practically realisable process matrices\, as we
 ll as challenges in formulating their composition. We make progress on addr
 essing such questions by connecting an important subset of process matrices
 \, namely quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC) wit
 h so-called causal boxes which describe practical quantum information proto
 cols in spacetime. Causal boxes are fully closed under composition and inco
 rporate physical principles such as relativistic causality in spacetime. We
   first identify a notion of operational equivalence between QC-QCs and cau
 sal boxes by connecting state spaces and operations in the two formalisms. 
 We then explicitly construct for each QC-QC an operationally equivalent cau
 sal box that satisfies certain special mathematical properties that allows 
 the causal box to be interpreted as a process\, this corresponds to a subse
 t of causal boxes previously known as process boxes. This allows us to defi
 ne composition of QC-QCs in terms of composition of causal boxes which is w
 ell-defined. We conjecture with a proof sketch that the spatiotemporal labe
 ls involved in their description can be simplified to a certain totally ord
 ered form. Based on this\, we establish through a constructive proof that e
 very process box can be mapped to an operationally equivalent QCQC. This in
 dicates that the subset of indefinite causal order processes realisable in 
 a background spacetime correspond to controlled superpositions of acyclic o
 rders\, which in particular rules out processes violating so-called causal 
 inequalities.  Our results shed light on the practicality and composability
  questions for indefinite causal structures while introducing new physicall
 y-motivated tools for studying their applications for quantum information p
 rocessing in spacetime.

DESCRIPTION:<span>Learning tasks play an increasingly prominent role in qua
 ntum information and computation. They range from fundamental problems such
  as state discrimination and metrology over the framework of quantum probab
 ly approximately correct (PAC) learning\, to the recently proposed shadow v
 ariants of state tomography. However\, the many directions of quantum learn
 ing theory have so far evolved separately. We propose a general mathematica
 l formalism for describing quantum learning by training on classical-quantu
 m data and then testing how well the learned hypothesis generalizes to new 
 data. In this framework\, we prove bounds on the expected generalization er
 ror of a quantum learner in terms of classical and quantum mutual informati
 on quantities measuring how strongly the learner's hypothesis depends on th
 e specific data seen during training. To achieve this\, we use tools from q
 uantum optimal transport and quantum concentration inequalities to establis
 h non-commutative versions of decoupling lemmas that underlie recent inform
 ation-theoretic generalization bounds for classical machine learning. Our f
 ramework encompasses and gives intuitively accessible generalization bounds
  for a variety of quantum learning scenarios such as quantum state discrimi
 nation\, PAC learning quantum states\, quantum parameter estimation\, and q
 uantumly PAC learning classical functions. Thereby\, our work lays a founda

DESCRIPTION:The limiting constraint on simulating materials on near-term qu
 antum hardware is the requisite circuit depths and qubit numbers\, with cur
 rent estimates placing them well beyond near-term capabilities. A critical 
 subroutine of simulation algorithms is implementing a layer of unitary evol
 utions by each local term in the Hamiltonian. In this work we develop a new
  quantum algorithm which dramatically reduces the estimated cost of materia
 l simulations using this subroutine\, improving circuit depths by up to 6 o
 rders of magnitude for Strontium Vanadate\, for example. We achieve this by
  introducing a fermionic encoding that leverages the locality of materials 
 Hamiltonians describing an active space in the Wannier basis. This design g
 enerates quantum circuits whose depth is independent of the system’s size.

 chieve it\, any information processing system needs an initial supply of re
 sources away from thermal equilibrium. Here we establish a fundamental limi
 t on the accuracy achievable with a given amount of nonequilibrium resource
 s. The limit applies to arbitrary information processing tasks and arbitrar
 y information processing systems subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. 
 It is easily computable and is expressed in terms of an entropic quantity\,
  which we name the reverse entropy\, associated to a time reversal of the i
 nformation processing task under consideration. The limit is achievable for
  all deterministic classical computations and for all their quantum extensi
 ons. As an application\, we establish the optimal tradeoff between nonequil
 ibrium and accuracy for the fundamental tasks of storing\, transmitting\, c
 loning\, and erasing information. Our results set a target for the design o
 f new devices approaching the ultimate efficiency limit\, and provide a fra

  their classical counterparts. This also implies a thermodynamic benchmark 
 to certify genuine quantum devices from their classical simulation.

DESCRIPTION:In this work we present a method for generating a fermionic enc
 oding tailored to a set of target fermionic operators and to a target hardw
 are connectivity. Our method uses brute force search\, over the space of al
 l encodings which map from Majorana monomials to Pauli operators\, to find 
 an encoding which optimizes a target cost function. In contrast to earlier 
 works in this direction\, our method searches over an extremely broad class
  of encodings which subsumes all known second quantized encodings that cons
 titute algebra homomorphisms. In order to search over this class\, we give 
 a clear mathematical explanation of how precisely it is characterized\, and
  how to translate this characterization into constructive search criteria. 
 A benefit of searching over this class is that our method is able to supply
  fairly general optimality guarantees on solutions. A second benefit is tha
 t our method is\, in principal\, capable of finding more efficient represen
 tations of fermionic systems when the set of fermionic operators under cons
 ideration are faithfully represented by a smaller quotient algebra. Given t
 he high algorithmic cost of performing the search\, we adapt our method to 
 handle translationally invariant systems that can be described by a small u
 nit cell that is less costly. We demonstrate our method on various pairings
  of target fermionic operators and hardware connectivities. We additionally
  show how our method can be extended to find error detecting fermionic enco
 dings in this class.

DESCRIPTION:The essential requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computatio
 n (FTQC) is the total protocol design to achieve a fair balance of all the 
 critical factors relevant to its practical realization\, such as the space 
 overhead\, the threshold\, and the modularity. A major obstacle in realizin
 g FTQC with conventional protocols\, such as those based on the surface cod
 e and the concatenated Steane code\, has been the space overhead\, i.e.\, t
 he required number of physical qubits per logical qubit. Protocols based on
  high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes gather considerabl
 e attention as a way to reduce the space overhead\, but problematically\, t
 he existing fault-tolerant protocols for such quantum LDPC codes sacrifice 
 the other factors. Here we construct a new fault-tolerant protocol to meet 
 these requirements simultaneously based on more recent progress on the tech
 niques for concatenated codes rather than quantum LDPC codes\, achieving a 
 constant space overhead\, a high threshold\, and flexibility in modular arc
 hitecture designs. In particular\, under a physical error rate of 0.1%\, ou
 r protocol reduces the space overhead to achieve the logical CNOT error rat
 es $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-24}$ by more than 90% and 97%\, respectively\, comp
 ared to the protocol for the surface code. Furthermore\, our protocol achie
 ves the threshold of 2.4% under a conventional circuit-level error model\, 
 substantially outperforming that of the surface code. The use of concatenat
 ed codes also naturally introduces abstraction layers essential for the mod

 nation approach opens a way to significantly save qubits in realizing FTQC 
 while fulfilling the other essential requirements for the practical protoco

DESCRIPTION:We systematically investigate quantum algorithms and lower boun
 ds for mean estimation given query access to non-identically distributed sa
 mples. On the one hand\, we give quantum mean estimators with quadratic qua
 ntum speed-up given samples from different bounded or sub-Gaussian random v
 ariables. On the other hand\, we prove that\, in general\, it is impossible
  for any quantum algorithm to achieve quadratic speed-up over the number of
  classical samples needed to estimate the mean $\\mu$\, where the samples c
 ome from different random variables with mean close to $\\mu$. Technically\
 , our quantum algorithms reduce bounded and sub-Gaussian random variables t
 o the Bernoulli case\, and use an uncomputation trick to overcome the chall
 enge that direct amplitude estimation does not work with non-identical quer
 y access. Our quantum query lower bounds are established by simulating non-
 identical oracles by parallel oracles\, and also by an adversarial method w
 ith non-identical oracles. Both results pave the way for proving quantum qu
 ery lower bounds with non-identical oracles in general\, which may be of in
 dependent interest.

 s/2304.13748</a>        <br> <br>Entanglement renormalization circuits are 
 quantum circuits that can be used to prepare large-scale entangled states. 
 For years\, it has remained a mystery whether there exist scale-invariant e
 ntanglement renormalization circuits for chiral topological order. In this 
 paper\, we solve this problem by demonstrating entanglement renormalization
  circuits for a wide class of chiral topologically ordered states\, includi
 ng a state sharing the same topological properties as Laughlin's bosonic fr
 actional quantum Hall state at filling fraction 1/4 and eight states with I
 sing-like non-Abelian fusion rules. The key idea is to build entanglement r
 enormalization circuits by interleaving the conventional multi-scale entang
 lement renormalization ansatz (MERA) circuit (made of spatially local gates
 ) with quasi-local evolution. Given the miraculous power of this circuit to
  prepare a wide range of chiral topologically ordered states\, we refer to 
 these circuits as MERA with quasi-local evolution (MERAQLE).

DESCRIPTION:<span>Harnessing quantum effects in metrology\, such as entangl
 ement and coherence\, enables enhanced sensitivity in measuring parameters.
  Despite this\, decoherence and time-dependent errors can uNdermine Heisenb
 erg-limited amplification. To navigate these challenges in realistic experi
 ments for phase estimation of a two-level unitary gate\, we introduce a sui
 te of quantum metrology algorithms. These algorithms capitalize on the univ
 ersality of quantum signal transformation to decouple two interdependent ph
 ase parameters into largely orthogonal ones\, ensuring that time-dependent 
 errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Our app
 roach combines provably optimal classical estimation with nearly optimal qu
 antum circuit design\, achieving unparalleled accuracy of 10−4 radians in s
 tandard deviation for estimating extremely small angles in superconducting 
 qubit experiments with low-depth (&lt\; 10) circuits. This accuracy surpass
 es existing alternatives by two orders of magnitude and is adaptable to ion
  trap gates. We prove both theoretically and numerically the optimality of 
 our algorithm against time-dependent phase error in φ. Remarkably\, in the 
 low circuit depth limit\, our method’s estimation variance on the time-sens
 itive parameter φ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg limit as a f
 unction of depth\, Var(φˆ) ∼ 1/d4. Crucially\, our method’s efficacy is rig
 orously affirmed through an analysis against the quantum Fisher information
 . This analysis underpins our protocol’s ability to achieve unmatched preci
 sion\, leveraging quantum resources more effectively than has been possible
  before.</span>

DESCRIPTION:One of the founding results of lattice based cryptography is a 
 quantum reduction from the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem to the Lear
 ning with Errors (LWE) problem introduced by Regev. It has recently been po
 inted out by Chen\, Liu and Zhandry[CLZ22] that this reduction can be made 
 more powerful by replacing the LWE problem with a quantum equivalent\, wher
 e the errors are given in quantum superposition. In parallel\, Regev's redu
 ction has recently been adapted in the context of code-based cryptography b
 y Debris\, Remaud and Tillich[DRT23]\, who showed a reduction between the S
 hort Codeword Problem and the Decoding Problem (the DRT reduction). This mo
 tivates the study of the Quantum Decoding Problem (QDP)\, which is the Deco
 ding Problem but with errors in quantum superposition and see how it behave
 s in the DRT reduction. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and to la
 y a firm foundation for QDP. We first show QD Pis likely to be easier than 
 classical decoding\, by proving that it can be solved in quantum polynomial
  time in a large regime of noise whereas no non-exponential quantum algorit
 hm is known for the classical decoding problem. Then\, we show that QDP can
  even be solved (albeit not necessarily efficiently) beyond the information
  theoretic Shannon limit for classical decoding. We give precisely the larg
 est noise level where we can solve QDP giving in a sense the information th
 eoretic limit for this new problem. Finally\, we study how QDP can be used 
 in the DRT reduction. First\, we show that our algorithms can be properly u
 sed in the DRT reduction showing that our quantum algorithms for QDP beyond
  Shannon capacity can be used to find minimal weight codewords in a random 
 code. On the negative side\, we show that the DRT reduction cannot be\, in 
 all generality\, a reduction between finding small codewords and QDP by exh
 ibiting quantum algorithms for QDP where this reduction entirely fails. Our
  proof techniques include the use of specific quantum measurements\, such a
 s q-ary unambiguous state discrimination and pretty good measurements as we
 ll as strong concentration bounds on weight distribution of random shifted 
 dual codes\, which we relate using quantum Fourier analysis.

 s/2212.06240</a>        <br> <br>Randomized shadow estimation is a recent p
 rotocol that allows estimating exponentially many expectation values of a q
 uantum state from ``classical shadows''\, obtained by applying random quant
 um circuits and computational basis measurements. In this paper we study th
 e statistical efficiency of this approach in light of near-term quantum com
 puting. In particular\, we propose and analyze a more practically-implement
 able variant of the protocol\, thrifty shadow estimation\, in which quantum
  circuits are reused many times instead of having to be freshly generated f
 or each measurement (as in the original protocol). We show that the effect 
 of this reuse strongly depends on the family of quantum circuits that is ch
 osen. In particular\, it is maximally effective when sampling Haar random u
 nitaries\, and maximally ineffective when sampling Clifford circuits (even

DESCRIPTION:We develop quantum information processing primitives for the pl
 anar rotor\, the state space of a particle on a circle. By interpreting rot
 or wavefunctions as periodically identified wavefunctions of a harmonic osc
 illator\, we determine the group of bosonic Gaussian operations inherited b
 y the rotor. This \\(n\\)-rotor Clifford group\, \\(\\text{U}(1)^{n(n+1)/2}
  \\rtimes \\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z})\\)\, is represented by continuous \\(\\
 text{U}(1)\\) gates generated by polynomials quadratic in angular momenta\,
  as well as discrete \\(\\text{GL}_n(\\mathbb Z)\\) momentum sign-flip and 
 sum gates. We classify homological rotor error-correcting codes {arXiv:2303
 .13723} and various rotor states based on equivalence under Clifford operat
 ions. Reversing direction\, we map homological rotor codes and rotor Cliffo
 rd operations back into oscillators by interpreting occupation-number state
 s as rotor states of non-negative angular momentum. This yields new multimo
 de homological bosonic codes protecting against dephasing and changes in oc
 cupation number\, along with their corresponding encoding and decoding circ
 uits. In particular\, we show how to non-destructively measure the oscillat
 or phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post selection. W
 e also outline several rotor and oscillator varieties of the GKP-stabilizer
  codes {arXiv:1903.12615}.

 sometry operations. We present the semidefinite programming (SDP) to search
  the Choi matrix representing a quantum circuit reversing any unitary opera
 tion. We derive a quantum circuit transforming four calls of any qubit-unit
 ary operation into its inverse operation by imposing the SU(2)×SU(2) symmet
 ry on the Choi matrix. This protocol only applies only for qubit-unitary op
 erations\, but we extend this protocol to any qubit-encoding isometry opera

 rotocol to an isometry inversion protocol by constructing a quantum circuit
  transforming finite sequential calls of any isometry operation into random
  unitary operations.

DESCRIPTION:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16379">https://arxiv.org/ab
 s/2211.16379</a><br> <br>We study an elementary Markov process on graphs ba
 sed on electric flow sampling (elfs). The elfs process repeatedly samples f
 rom an electric flow on a graph. While the sinks of the flow are fixed\, th
 e source is updated using the electric flow sample\, and the process ends w
 hen it hits a sink vertex.<br>We argue that this process naturally connects
  to many key quantities of interest. E.g.\, we describe a random walk coupl
 ing which implies that the elfs process has the same arrival distribution a
 s a random walk. We also analyze the electric hitting time\, which is the e
 xpected time before the process hits a sink vertex. As our main technical c
 ontribution\, we show that the electric hitting time on trees is logarithmi
 c in the graph size and weights.<br>The initial motivation behind the elfs 
 process is that quantum walks can sample from electric flows\, and they can
  hence implement this process very naturally. This yields a quantum walk al
 gorithm for sampling from the random walk arrival distribution\, which has 
 widespread applications. It complements the existing line of quantum walk s
 earch algorithms which only return an element from the sink\, but yield no 
 insight in the distribution of the returned element. By our bound on the el
 ectric hitting time on trees\, the quantum walk algorithm on trees requires
  quadratically fewer steps than the random walk hitting time\, up to polylo
 g factors.

 how that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states using on

 learning quantum dynamics\, and further opens up new methods for both the c

 xiv.org/pdf/2305.15625.pdf</span></a> <br> <br>We show that a quantum spin 
 system has an exact description by noninteracting fermions if its frustrati
 on graph is claw-free and contains a simplicial clique. The frustration gra
 ph of a spin model captures the pairwise anticommutation relations between 
 Pauli terms of its Hamiltonian in a given basis. This result captures a vas
 t family of known free-fermion solutions. In previous work\, it was shown t
 hat a free-fermion solution exists if the frustration graph is either a lin
 e graph\, or (even-hole\, claw)-free. The former case generalizes the celeb
 rated Jordan-Wigner transformation and includes the exact solution to the K
 itaev honeycomb model. The latter case generalizes a nonlocal solution to t
 he four-fermion model given by Fendley. Our characterization unifies these 
 two approaches\, extending generalized Jordan-Wigner solutions to the nonlo
 cal setting and generalizing the four-fermion solution to models of arbitra
 ry spatial dimension. Our key technical insight is the identification of a 
 class of cycle symmetries for all models with claw-free frustration graphs.
  We prove that these symmetries commute\, and this allows us to apply Fendl
 ey's solution method to each symmetric subspace independently. Finally\, we
  give a physical description of the fermion modes in terms of operators gen
 erated by repeated commutation with the Hamiltonian. This connects our fram
 ework to the developing body of work on operator Krylov subspaces. Our resu
 lts deepen the existing connection between many-body physics and the mathem
 atical theory of claw-free graphs.

DESCRIPTION:Invited talk<br> <br>As the field of quantum computing evolves\
 , understanding the    potential and limitations of near-term quantum devic
 es becomes    paramount. This talk will focus on how noise constraints the 
    computational power of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)    device
 s\, with a particular focus on applications to optimization.<br>    <br>   
  Firstly\, we will show how entropic inequalities\, optimal transport    te
 chniques\, and classical Gibbs state sampling methods offer a clear    comp
 arison between the performance of classical and quantum    algorithms under
  noise for a diverse set of problems\, showing that    under local depolari
 zing noise with depolarizing probability p\, twe    lose quantum advantage 
 at depth 1/p. Our findings suggest that a    significant quantum advantage 
 is unlikely under current noise rates    for classical optimization problem
 s\, even with increased qubit    count. We also prove that QAOA does not of
 fer exponential advantage    under noise for certain combinatorial optimiza
 tion problems.<br>    Secondly\, we will analyze what error mitigation tech
 niques can    alleviate these conclusions and study the limitations of such
     methods. By drawing a connection between error mitigation and    statis
 tical inference\, we will show that error mitigation techniques    necessar
 ily incur a sampling overhead that is exponential in depth    for any quant
 um circuit. Furthermore\, we will construct large    families of circuits f
 or which the sampling overhead of error    mitigation is exponential both i
 n depth and the number of qubits.<br>    Finally\, we will discuss extensio
 ns of these results beyond the    circuit model of quantum computing and to
  what extent they    generalize to non-unital noise models.<br>    <p><br><

DESCRIPTION:We propose a family of explicit fault-tolerant geometrically lo
 cal circuits realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase. These circ
 uits are constructed by relating them to discrete fixed-point path integral
 s\, specifically the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional 
 cellulation\, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum do
 uble model. The resulting circuits are based on the well-known syndrome ext
 raction circuit of the (qudit) toric code with $8$ controlled-$X$ gates per
  spacetime unit cell\, into which we insert non-Pauli phase gates that impl
 ement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate\, 
 in contrast to the few known constructions for twisted abelian phases. The 
 simplest example is a fault-tolerant circuit for the double-semion phase\, 
 which consists of $12$ controlled-$S$ gates in addition to the $8$ controll
 ed-$X$ gates per spacetime unit cell. We also show that other architectures
  for the qudit toric code phase\, like measurement-based topological quantu
 m computation\, or Floquet codes\, can be equipped with phase gates impleme
 nting the twist. As a further result\, we prove fault tolerance for a very 
 general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-p
 oint circuits\, which includes the circuits in this paper as well as the st
 andard toric code\, subsystem toric codes\, measurement-based topological q
 uantum computation\, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. The noise model w
 e use includes arbitrary local noise\, including weakly correlated noise an
 d non-Pauli noise\, for which explicit fault-tolerance proofs might not exi
 st in the literature to date. In the appendix we present a simple combinato
 rial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cell
 ulation\, which might be interesting in its own right for the study of twis
 ted gauge theory.

DESCRIPTION:A recent line of work has shown the unconditional advantage of 
 constant-depth quantum computation\, or QNC0\, over NC0\, AC0\, and related
  models of classical computation. Problems exhibiting this advantage includ
 e search and sampling tasks related to the parity function\, and it is natu
 ral to ask whether QNC0 can be used to help compute parity itself. Namely\,
  we study AC0◦QNC0—a hybrid circuit model where AC0 operates on measurement
  outcomes of a QNC0 circuit—and we ask whether Par ∈ AC0◦QNC0. We believe t
 he answer is negative. In fact\, we conjecture AC0◦QNC0 cannot even achieve
  Ω(1) correlation with parity. As evidence for this conjecture\, we prove t
 he following: • When the QNC0 circuit is ancilla-free\, we show this model 
 can achieve only negligible correlation with parity\, even when AC0 is repl
 aced with any function having LMN-like decay in its Fourier spectrum. • For
  the general (non-ancilla-free) case\, we show via a connection to nonlocal
  games that the conjecture holds for any class of postprocessing functions 
 that has approximate degree o(n) and is closed under restrictions. Moreover
 \, this is true even when the QNC0 circuit is given arbitrary quantum advic
 e. By known results\, this conﬁrms the conjecture for linear-size AC0 circu
 its. • Another approach to proving the conjecture is to show a switching le
 mma for AC0◦QNC0. Towards this goal\, we study the effect of quantum prepro
 cessing on the decision tree complexity of Boolean functions. We ﬁnd that f
 rom the point of view of a decision tree\, nonlocal channels are no better 
 than randomness: a Boolean function f precomposed with an n-party nonlocal 
 channel is together equal to a randomized decision tree with depth no great
 er than DTdepth[f]. Taken together\, our results suggest that while QNC0 is
  surprisingly powerful for search and sampling\, that power is “locked away
 ” in the global correlations of its output\, inaccessible to simple classic
 al computation for solving decision problems.<br><br><br><br><p><a></a></p>

DESCRIPTION:<span>While quantum state tomography has been extensively analy
 sed for qubit and qudit systems\, rigorous performance guarantees in terms 
 of ε-approximation in trace distance remain largely unexplored for continuo
 us variable quantum systems\, due to subtleties that arise in the infinite-
 dimensional context. This work addresses this gap. First\, we discover that
  to learn energy-constrained n-mode states\, the sample complexity must sca
 le with ε as Ω(1/ε^(2n)). This is in sharp contrast with the n-qubit case\,
  where the ε-scaling is O(1/ε^2) — thereby establishing the extreme ineffic
 iency of continuous variable tomography. Remarkably\, we prove that O(1/ε^(
 2n)) copies are both necessary and sufficient if we restrict to tomography 
 of pure states. Second\, we establish that Gaussian states can be efficient
 ly learned\, a result that has been previously assumed but never rigorously
  proved. To do that\, we answer the following fundamental question for Gaus
 sian quantum information: If we approximate the first moment and covariance
  matrix of an unknown Gaussian state with precision ε\, what is the resulti
 ng trace distance error on the state? Third\, we show how to efficiently le
 arn states prepared by Gaussian unitaries and a few local non-Gaussian evol
 utions\, unveiling more on the structure of these slightly non-Gaussian sys
 tems.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<span>Reliable quantum technology requires knowledge of the dyn
 amics governing the underlying system. This problem of characterizing and b
 enchmarking quantum devices or experiments in continuous time is referred t
 o as the Hamiltonian learning problem. In contrast to multi-qubit systems\,
  learning guarantees for the dynamics of bosonic systems have hitherto rema
 ined mostly unexplored. For m-mode Hamiltonians given as polynomials in ann
 ihilation and creation operators with modes arranged on a lattice\, we esta
 blish a simple moment criterion in terms of the particle number operator wh
 ich ensures that learning strategies from the finite-dimensional setting ex
 tend to the bosonic setting\, requiring only coherent states and heterodyne
  detection on the experimental side. We then propose an enhanced procedure 
 based on added dissipation that even works if the Hamiltonian time evolutio
 n violates this moment criterion: With high success probability it learns a
 ll coefficients of the Hamiltonian to accuracy ε using a total evolution ti
 me of O(ε−2 log(m)). Our protocol involves the experimentally reachable res
 ources of projected coherent state preparation\, dissipative regularization
  akin to recent quantum error correction schemes involving cat qubits stabi
 lized by a nonlinear multi-photon driven dissipation process\, and heterody
 ne measurements. As a crucial step in our analysis\, we establish our momen
 t criterion and a new Lieb-Robinson type bound for the evolution generated 
 by an arbitrary bosonic Hamiltonian of bounded degree in the annihilation a
 nd creation operators combined with photon-driven dissipation. Our work dem
 onstrates that a broad class of bosonic Hamiltonians can be efficiently lea
 rned from simple quantum experiments\, and our bosonic Lieb-Robinson bound 
 may independently serve as a versatile tool for studying evolutions on cont
 inuous variable systems.</span>

DESCRIPTION:Barren plateaus have emerged as a pivotal challenge for variati
 onal quantum computing. Our understanding of this phenomenon underwent a tr
 ansformative shift with the recent introduction of a Lie algebraic theory c
 apable of explaining most sources of barren plateaus. However\, this theory
  requires either initial states or observables that lie in the circuit's Li
 e algebra. Focusing on parametrized matchgate circuits\, in this work we ar
 e able to go beyond this assumption and provide an exact formula for the lo
 ss function variance that is valid for arbitrary input states and measureme
 nts. Our results reveal that new phenomena emerge when the Lie algebra cons
 traint is relaxed. For instance\, we find that the variance does not necess
 arily vanish inversely with the Lie algebra's dimension. Instead\, this mea
 sure of expressivity is replaced by a generalized expressivity quantity: th
 e dimension of the Lie group modules. By characterizing the operators in th
 ese modules as products of Majorana operators\, we can introduce a precise 
 notion of generalized globality and show that measuring generalized-global 
 operators leads to barren plateaus. Our work also provides operational mean
 ing to the generalized entanglement as we connect it with known fermionic e
 ntanglement measures\, and show that it satisfies a monogamy relation. Fina
 lly\, while parameterized matchgate circuits are not efficiently simulable 
 in general\, our results suggest that the structure allowing for trainabili
 ty may also lead to classical simulability.

 sk of testing the validity of a hypothesis underlies numerous applications 
 in quantum information theory. The most commonly investigated approach is t
 hat of gathering all the available (quantum) data and making a final decisi
 on based on a collective measurement. However\, such offline strategies are
  often far from practical\, both in the amount of data required as well as 
 in the complexity of the required measurement. In some settings\, when the 
 goal is quick detection\, offline algorithms are not applicable at all\, as
  they can only make a decision once all samples are received. Sequential me
 thods offer the use of online strategies\, where samples are requested on a
  need-to-know basis\, drastically reducing the number of required samples i
 n order to guarantee the\, task specific\, associated performance criteria.
  While extensively investigated and applied in the classical setting\, we k

 uantum data is available. In this joint submission we present major recent 
 progress on sequential methods for the fundamental tasks of quantum state d

DESCRIPTION:Despite the fundamental role the Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT) 
 problem has played in quantum complexity theory\, a central question remain
 s open: At which local dimension does the complexity of QSAT transition fro
 m "easy" to "hard"? Here\, we study QSAT with each constraint acting on a k
 -dimensional and l-dimensional qudit pair\, denoted (k\,l)-QSAT. Our first 
 main result shows that\, surprisingly\, QSAT on qubits can remain QMA_1-har
 d\, in that (2\,5)-QSAT is QMA_1-complete. (QMA_1 is a quantum analogue of 
 MA with perfect completeness.) In contrast\, (2\,2)-QSAT (i.e. Quantum 2-SA
 T on qubits) is well-known to be poly-time solvable [Bravyi\, 2006]. Our se
 cond main result proves that (3\,d)-QSAT on the 1D line with d = O(1) is al
 so QMA_1-hard. Finally\, we initiate the study of (2\,d)-QSAT on the 1D lin
 e by giving a frustration-free 1D Hamiltonian with a unique\, entangled gro
 und state. As implied by our title\, our first result uses a direct embeddi
 ng: We combine a novel clock construction with the 2D circuit-to-Hamiltonia
 n construction of [Gosset and Nagaj\, 2013]. Of note is a new simplified an
 d analytic proof for the latter (as opposed to a partially numeric proof in
  [GN13]). This exploits Unitary Labelled Graphs [Bausch\, Cubitt\, Ozols\, 
 2017] together with a new "Nullspace Connection Lemma"\, allowing us to bre
 ak low energy analyses into small patches of projectors\, and to improve th
 e soundness analysis of [GN13] from Omega(1/T^6) to Omega(1/T^2)\, for T th
 e number of gates. Our second result goes via black-box reduction: Given an
  arbitrary 1D Hamiltonian H on d'-dimensional qudits\, we show how to embed
  it into an effective 1D (3\,d)-QSAT instance\, for d = O(1). Our approach 
 may be viewed as a weaker notion of "simulation" (à la [Bravyi\, Hastings 2
 017]\, [Cubitt\, Montanaro\, Piddock 2018]). As far as we are aware\, this 
 gives the first "black-box simulation"-based QMA_1-hardness result.

DESCRIPTION:Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom unitaries (
 PRUs) possess the dual nature of being efficiently constructible while appe
 aring completely random to any efficient quantum algorithm. In this study\,
  we establish fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and
  PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible\, 
 ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tol
 erant quantum computers. Additionally\, we derive lower bounds on the imagi
 narity and coherence of PRSs and PRUs\, rule out the existence of sparse or
  real PRUs. We also show that the notions of PRS\, PRUs and pseudorandom sc
 ramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introdu
 ce the concept of pseudoresources\, where states which contain a low amount
  of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudoco
 herence\, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity\, and identify three distinct 
 types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our w
 ork also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing\
 , demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum s
 tates from imaginary ones\, in contrast to the efficient measurability of u
 nitary imaginarity. Lastly\, we show that the transformation from a complex
  to a real model of quantum computation is inefficient\, in contrast to the
  reverse process\, which is efficient. Our results establish fundamental li
 mits on property testing and provide valuable insights into quantum pseudor
 andomness.

DESCRIPTION:We study the complexity of a classic problem in computational t
 opology\, the homology problem: given a description of some space X and an 
 integer k\, decide if X contains a k-dimensional hole. The setting and stat
 ement of the homology problem are completely classical\, yet we find that t
 he complexity is characterized by quantum complexity classes. Our result ca
 n be seen as an aspect of a connection between homology and supersymmetric 
 quantum mechanics [Wit82]. We consider clique complexes\, motivated by the 
 practical application of topological data analysis (TDA). The clique comple
 x of a graph is the simplicial complex formed by declaring every k+1-clique
  in the graph to be a k-simplex. Our main result is that deciding whether t
 he clique complex of a weighted graph has a hole or not\, given a suitable 
 promise on the gap\, is QMA1-hard and contained in QMA. Our main innovation
  is a technique to lower bound the eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplaci
 an operator. For this\, we invoke a tool from algebraic topology known as s
 pectral sequences. In particular\, we exploit a connection between spectral
  sequences and Hodge theory [For94]. Spectral sequences will play a role an
 alogous to perturbation theory for combinatorial Laplacians. In addition\, 
 we develop the simplicial surgery technique used in prior work [CK22]. Our 
 result provides some suggestion that the quantum TDA algorithm [LGZ16] cann
 ot be dequantized. More broadly\, we hope that our results will open up new
  possibilities for quantum advantage in topological data analysis.

DESCRIPTION:<i><i>Graphical models offer a unifying framework for various s
 tatistical learning algorithms and models. Central to these models are the 
 forward and backward mapping problems\, which have been studied through bot
 h exact and approximate algorithms. This talk explores these mapping proble
 ms within the context of quantum graphical models\, where quantum states ge
 neralize classical probability distributions.<br>The forward mapping proble
 m involves deriving mean parameters from model parameters and is closely li
 nked to approximating the partition function---a typically challenging task
  often requiring heuristics and approximations. We'll discuss quantum belie
 f propagation\, which has shown success in one-dimensional systems\, as wel
 l as variational methods such as Markov entropy decomposition that tackle t
 he problem from an optimization perspective.<br>The task of the backward ma
 pping problem aims to compute model parameters from mean parameters. It is 
 related to the Hamiltonian learning problem\, a topic of growing interest i
 n quantum information science lately. We'll review some existing algorithms
  and introduce the quantum iterative scaling (QIS) algorithm that reduces t
 he backward mapping problem to a series of forward mapping problems. We'll 
 present a convergence proof for QIS and demonstrate its advantages over gra
 dient descent methods. Furthermore\, we'll explore how quasi-Newton methods
  can enhance QIS and gradient descent algorithms\, showcasing significant e
 fficiency improvements.</i></i>

DESCRIPTION:<span>A basic question in the PAC model of learning is whether 
 proper learning is harder than improper learning. In the classical case\, t
 he answer to this question\, with respect to sample complexity\, is known t
 o depend on the concept class. While there are concept classes for which th
 e two modes of learning have the same complexity\, there are examples of co
 ncept classes with VC dimension d that have sample complexity Ω ( d/ε log 1
 /ε) for proper learning with error ε\, while the complexity for improper le
 arning is O( d/ε). One such example arises from the Coupon Collector proble
 m. Motivated by the efficiency of proper versus improper learning with quan
 tum samples\, Arunachalam\, Belovs\, Childs\, Kothari\, Rosmanis\, and de W
 olf [1] studied an analogue\, the Quantum Coupon Collector problem. Curious
 ly\, they discovered that for learning size k subsets of [n] the problem ha
 s sample complexity Θ(k log min {k\, n − k + 1})\, in contrast with the com
 plexity of Θ(k log k) for Coupon Collector. This effectively negates the po
 ssibility of a separation between the two modes of learning via the quantum
  problem\, and Arunachalam et al. posed the possibility of such a separatio
 n as an open question. In this work\, we first present an algorithm for the
  Quantum Coupon Collector problem with sample complexity that matches the s
 harper lower bound of (1 − o_k(1))k ln min {k\, n − k + 1} shown recently b
 y Bab Hadiashar\, Nayak\, and Sinha [7]\, for the entire range of the param
 eter k. Next\, we devise a variant of the problem\, the Quantum Padded Coup
 on Collector. We prove that its sample complexity matches that of the class
 ical Coupon Collector problem for both modes of learning\, thereby exhibiti
 ng the same asymptotic separation between proper and improper quantum learn
 ing as mentioned above. The techniques we develop in the process can be dir
 ectly applied to any form of padded quantum data. We hope that padding can 
 more generally lift other forms of classical learning behaviour to the quan
 tum setting.</span>

DESCRIPTION:We address a question of leveraging the noise bias to simplify 
 quantum error correction (QEC) protocols and improve their performance. We 
 focus on the previously unexplored bias between the amplitude damping and d
 ephasing errors that is fundamental to many quantum technologies. We propos
 e a simple scheme to convert amplitude damping errors into erasure errors. 
 Despite its simplicity\, our scheme significantly improves the performance 
 of QEC protocols and can be extended to handle leakage errors. Importantly\
 , we provide two concrete realizations with superconducting circuits\, anal
 yzing their performance both from the analytical and numerical perspective.
  Our results provide a breakthrough shift in the current architecture parad
 igm. Namely\, they suggest that engineering efforts should focus on improvi
 ng the dephasing and the quality of quantum coherent control\, as they effe
 ctively limit the performance of fault-tolerant protocols.

DESCRIPTION:<p><span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04841" target="_bl
 ank"><i></i></a></span></p><br><br>We define a general formulation of quant
 um PCPs\, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers\, and 
 give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonia
 n with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile su
 broutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs\, allowing us to show: (i) Non
 -adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number o
 f proof queries is constant. In fact\, this can even be shown to hold when 
 the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at ra
 ndom from a subset of all possible index combinations\, answering an open q
 uestion by Aharonov\, Arad\, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the q-
 local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in 𝖰𝖢𝖬
 𝖠\, then 𝖰𝖯𝖢𝖯[q] is in 𝖰𝖢𝖬𝖠 for any constant q. (iii) If 𝖰𝖬𝖠(k)
  has a quantum PCP for any k=poly(n)\, then 𝖰𝖬𝖠(2) = 𝖰𝖬𝖠\, connecting
  two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Mo
 reover\, we also show that there exists (quantum) oracles relative to which
  certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence\, any attempt to prove the
  quantum PCP conjecture requires\, just as was the case for the classical P
 CP theorem\, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.<br> <br><a href="http

DESCRIPTION:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11490">https://arxiv.org/ab
 s/2210.11490</a>        <br>Recent progress in the development of quantum t
 echnologies has enabled the direct investigation of dynamics of increasingl
 y complex quantum many-body systems. This motivates the study of the comple
 xity of classical algorithms for this problem in order to benchmark quantum
  simulators and to delineate the regime of quantum advantage. Here we prese
 nt classical algorithms for approximating the dynamics of local observables
  and nonlocal quantities such as the Loschmidt echo\, where the evolution i
 s governed by a local Hamiltonian. For short times\, their computational co
 st scales polynomially with the system size and the inverse of the approxim
 ation error. In the case of local observables\, the proposed algorithm has 
 a better dependence on the approximation error than algorithms based on the
  Lieb–Robinson bound. Our results use cluster expansion techniques adapted 
 to the dynamical setting\, for which we give a novel proof of their converg
 ence. This has important physical consequences besides our efficient algori
 thms. In particular\, we establish a novel quantum speed limit\, a bound on
  dynamical phase transitions\, and a concentration bound for product states
  evolved for short times.

DESCRIPTION:Quantum query complexity has several nice properties with respe
 ct to composition. First\, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be co
 mposed without incurring log factors through error reduction (\\emph{exactn
 ess}). Second\, through careful accounting (\\emph{thriftiness})\, the tota
 l query complexity is smaller if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inpu
 ts -- a property that is much less obvious in quantum algorithms than in th
 eir classical counterparts. While these properties were previously seen thr
 ough the model of span programs (alternatively\, the dual adversary bound)\
 , a recent work by two of the authors (Belovs\, Yolcu 2023) showed how to a
 chieve these benefits without converting to span programs\, by defining \\e
 mph{quantum Las Vegas query complexity}. Independently\, recent works\, inc
 luding by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022)\, have worked towards bringing 
 thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of quantum \\emph{t
 ime} complexity. In this work\, we show how to achieve both exactness and t
 hriftiness in the setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum sub
 routine composition results of Jeffery 2022 so that\, in particular\, no er
 ror reduction is needed. We give a time complexity version of the well-know
 n result in quantum query complexity\, $Q(f\\circ g)=\\OO(Q(f)\\cdot Q(g))$
 \, without log factors. We achieve this by employing a novel approach to th
 e design of quantum algorithms based on what we call \\emph{transducers}\, 
 and which we think is of large independent interest. While a span program i
 s a completely different computational model\, a transducer is a direct gen
 eralisation of a quantum algorithm\, which allows for much greater transpar
 ency and control. Transducers naturally characterize general state conversi
 on\, rather than only decision problems\; provide a very simple treatment o
 f other quantum primitives such as quantum walks\; and lend themselves well
  to time complexity analysis.
